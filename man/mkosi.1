.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[V]mkosi\f[R] is a tool for easily building customized OS images.
It\[cq]s a fancy wrapper around \f[V]dnf --installroot\f[R],
\f[V]apt\f[R], \f[V]pacman\f[R] and \f[V]zypper\f[R] that may generate
disk images with a number of bells and whistles.
.SS Command Line Verbs
.PP
The following command line verbs are known:
.TP
\f[V]summary\f[R]
Outputs a human-readable summary of all options used for building an
image.
This will parse the command line and \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] file as it
would do on \f[V]build\f[R], but only output what it is configured for
and not actually build anything.\[ga]
.TP
\f[V]build\f[R]
This builds the image based on the settings passed in on the command
line or read from a \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] file.
This command is the default if no verb is explicitly specified.
This command must be executed as \f[V]root\f[R].
Any arguments passed after the \f[V]build\f[R] verb are passed as
arguments to the build script (if there is one).
.TP
\f[V]shell\f[R]
This builds the image if it is not built yet, and then invokes
\f[V]systemd-nspawn\f[R] to acquire an interactive shell prompt in it.
An optional command line may be specified after the \f[V]shell\f[R]
verb, to be invoked in place of the shell in the container.
Use \f[V]-f\f[R] in order to rebuild the image unconditionally before
acquiring the shell, see below.
This command must be executed as \f[V]root\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]boot\f[R]
Similar to \f[V]shell\f[R], but boots the image using
\f[V]systemd-nspawn\f[R].
An optional command line may be specified after the \f[V]boot\f[R] verb,
which is then passed as the \[lq]kernel command line\[rq] to the init
system in the image.
.TP
\f[V]qemu\f[R]
Similar to \f[V]boot\f[R], but uses \f[V]qemu\f[R] to boot up the image,
i.e.\ instead of container virtualization virtual machine virtualization
is used.
This verb is only supported for disk images that contain a boot loader.
Any arguments specified after the \f[V]qemu\f[R] verb are appended to
the \f[V]qemu\f[R] invocation.
.TP
\f[V]ssh\f[R]
When the image is built with the \f[V]Ssh=yes\f[R] option, this command
connects to a booted (\f[V]boot\f[R], \f[V]qemu\f[R] verbs) container or
VM via SSH.
Make sure to run \f[V]mkosi ssh\f[R] with the same config as
\f[V]mkosi build\f[R] was run with so that it has the necessary
information available to connect to the running container/VM via SSH.
Any arguments passed after the \f[V]ssh\f[R] verb are passed as
arguments to the \f[V]ssh\f[R] invocation.
.TP
\f[V]clean\f[R]
Remove build artifacts generated on a previous build.
If combined with \f[V]-f\f[R], also removes incremental build cache
images.
If \f[V]-f\f[R] is specified twice, also removes any package cache.
.TP
\f[V]serve\f[R]
This builds the image if it is not built yet, and then serves the output
directory (i.e.\ usually \f[V]mkosi.output/\f[R], see below) via a small
embedded HTTP server, listening on port 8081.
Combine with \f[V]-f\f[R] in order to rebuild the image unconditionally
before serving it.
This command is useful for testing network based acquisition of OS
images, for example via \f[V]machinectl pull-raw \&...\f[R] and
\f[V]machinectl   pull-tar \&...\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]bump\f[R]
Determines the current image version string (as configured with
\f[V]ImageVersion=\f[R]/\f[V]--image-version=\f[R]), increases its last
dot-separated component by one and writes the resulting version string
to \f[V]mkosi.version\f[R].
This is useful for implementing a simple versioning scheme: each time
this verb is called the version is bumped in preparation for the
subsequent build.
Note that \f[V]--auto-bump\f[R]/\f[V]-B\f[R] may be used to
automatically bump the version after each successful build.
.TP
\f[V]genkey\f[R]
Generate a pair of SecureBoot keys for usage with the
\f[V]SecureBootKey=\f[R]/\f[V]--secure-boot-key=\f[R] and
\f[V]SecureBootCertificate=\f[R]/\f[V]--secure-boot-certificate=\f[R]
options.
.TP
\f[V]help\f[R]
This verb is equivalent to the \f[V]--help\f[R] switch documented below:
it shows a brief usage explanation.
.SS Execution Flow
.PP
Execution flow for \f[V]mkosi build\f[R].
Default values/calls are shown in parentheses.
When building with \f[V]--incremental\f[R] mkosi creates a cache of the
distribution installation if not already existing and replaces the
distribution installation in consecutive runs with data from the cached
one.
.IP \[bu] 2
Copy skeleton trees (\f[V]mkosi.skeleton\f[R]) into image
.IP \[bu] 2
Install distribution and packages into image or use cache tree if
available
.IP \[bu] 2
Install build packages in overlay if a build script is configured
.IP \[bu] 2
Run prepare script on image and on image + build overlay if a build
script is configured (\f[V]mkosi.prepare\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Run build script on image + build overlay if a build script is
configured (\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Copy the build script outputs into the image
.IP \[bu] 2
Copy the extra trees into the image (\f[V]mkosi.extra\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Run \f[V]kernel-install\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Install systemd-boot
.IP \[bu] 2
Run post-install script (\f[V]mkosi.postinst\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Run \f[V]systemctl preset-all\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Remove packages and files (\f[V]RemovePackages=\f[R],
\f[V]RemoveFiles=\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Run finalize script (\f[V]mkosi.finalize\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
Run SELinux relabel is a SELinux policy is installed
.IP \[bu] 2
Generate unified kernel image
.IP \[bu] 2
Generate final output format
.SS Supported output formats
.PP
The following output formats are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
Raw \f[I]GPT\f[R] disk image, created using systemd-repart
.IP \[bu] 2
Plain directory, containing the OS tree (\f[I]directory\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
btrfs subvolume
.IP \[bu] 2
Tar archive (\f[I]tar\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
CPIO archive (\f[I]cpio\f[R]) in the format appropriate for a kernel
initrd
.PP
When a \f[I]GPT\f[R] disk image is created, repart partition definition
files may be placed in \f[V]mkosi.repart/\f[R] to configure the
generated disk image.
.SS Configuration Settings
.PP
The following settings can be set through configuration files (the
syntax with \f[V]SomeSetting=value\f[R]) and on the command line (the
syntax with \f[V]--some-setting=value\f[R]).
For some command line parameters, a single-letter shortcut is also
allowed.
In the configuration files, the setting must be in the appropriate
section, so the settings are grouped by section below.
.PP
Configuration is parsed in the following order:
.IP \[bu] 2
The command line arguments are parsed
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] is parsed if it exists in the directory set with
\f[V]--directory=\f[R] or the current working directory if
\f[V]--directory=\f[R] is not used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]mkosi.conf.d/\f[R] is parsed in the same directory if it exists.
Each directory and each file with the \f[V].conf\f[R] extension in
\f[V]mkosi.conf.d/\f[R] is parsed.
Any directory in \f[V]mkosi.conf.d\f[R] is parsed as if it were a
regular top level directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
Any default paths (depending on the option) are configured if the
corresponding path exists.
.PP
If a setting is specified multiple times across the different sources of
configuration, the first assignment that is found is used.
For example, a setting specified on the command line will always take
precedence over the same setting configured in a config file.
To override settings in a dropin file, make sure your dropin file is
alphanumerically ordered before the config file that you\[cq]re trying
to override.
.PP
Settings that take a list of values are merged by prepending each value
to the previously configured values.
If a value of a list setting is prefixed with \f[V]!\f[R], if any later
assignment of that setting tries to add the same value, that value is
ignored.
Values prefixed with \f[V]!\f[R] can be globs to ignore more than one
value.
.PP
To conditionally include configuration files, the \f[V][Match]\f[R]
section can be used.
A configuration file is only included if all the conditions in the
\f[V][Match]\f[R] block are satisfied.
If a condition in \f[V][Match]\f[R] depends on a setting and the setting
has not been explicitly configured when the condition is evaluated, the
setting is assigned its default value.
.PP
Command line options that take no argument are shown without \[lq]=\[rq]
in their long version.
In the config files, they should be specified with a boolean argument:
either \[lq]1\[rq], \[lq]yes\[rq], or \[lq]true\[rq] to enable, or
\[lq]0\[rq], \[lq]no\[rq], \[lq]false\[rq] to disable.
.SS [Match] Section.
.TP
\f[V]Distribution=\f[R]
Matches against the configured distribution.
.TP
\f[V]Release=\f[R]
Matches against the configured distribution release.
If this condition is used and no distribution has been explicitly
configured yet, the host distribution and release are used.
.TP
\f[V]PathExists=\f[R]
This condition is satisfied if the given path exists.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the parent directory of the
config file that the condition is read from.
.SS [Distribution] Section
.TP
\f[V]Distribution=\f[R], \f[V]--distribution=\f[R], \f[V]-d\f[R]
The distribution to install in the image.
Takes one of the following arguments: \f[V]fedora\f[R],
\f[V]debian\f[R], \f[V]ubuntu\f[R], \f[V]arch\f[R], \f[V]opensuse\f[R],
\f[V]mageia\f[R], \f[V]centos\f[R], \f[V]openmandriva\f[R],
\f[V]rocky\f[R], and \f[V]alma\f[R].
If not specified, defaults to the distribution of the host.
Whenever a distribution is assigned, the release is reset to the default
release configured for that distribution.
.TP
\f[V]Release=\f[R], \f[V]--release=\f[R], \f[V]-r\f[R]
The release of the distribution to install in the image.
The precise syntax of the argument this takes depends on the
distribution used, and is either a numeric string (in case of Fedora
Linux, CentOS, \&..., e.g.\ \f[V]29\f[R]), or a distribution version
name (in case of Debian, Ubuntu, \&..., e.g.\ \f[V]artful\f[R]).
Defaults to a recent version of the chosen distribution.
.TP
\f[V]Mirror=\f[R], \f[V]--mirror=\f[R], \f[V]-m\f[R]
The mirror to use for downloading the distribution packages.
Expects a mirror URL as argument.
.TP
\f[V]LocalMirror=\f[R], \f[V]--local-mirror=\f[R]
The mirror will be used as a local, plain and direct mirror instead of
using it as a prefix for the full set of repositories normally supported
by distributions.
Useful for fully offline builds with a single repository.
Supported on deb/rpm/arch based distributions.
Overrides \f[V]--mirror=\f[R] but only for the local mkosi build, it
will not be configured inside the final image, \f[V]--mirror=\f[R] (or
the default repository) will be configured inside the final image
instead.
.TP
\f[V]RepositoryKeyCheck=\f[R], \f[V]--repository-key-check=\f[R]
Controls signature/key checks when using repositories, enabled by
default.
Useful to disable checks when combined with \f[V]--local-mirror=\f[R]
and using only a repository from a local filesystem.
Not used for DNF-based distros yet.
.TP
\f[V]Repositories=\f[R], \f[V]--repositories=\f[R]
Additional package repositories to use during installation.
Expects one or more URLs as argument, separated by commas.
This option may be used multiple times, in which case the list of
repositories to use is combined.
Use \[lq]!*\[rq] to remove all repositories from to the list or use
e.g.\ \[lq]!repo-url\[rq] to remove just one specific repository.
For Arch Linux, additional repositories must be passed in the form
\f[V]<name>::<url>\f[R] (e.g.\ \f[V]myrepo::https://myrepo.net\f[R]).
.TP
\f[V]RepositoryDirectories\f[R], \f[V]--repo-dir=\f[R]
This option can (for now) only be used with RPM-based distributions and
Arch Linux.
It takes a comma separated list of directories containing extra
repository definitions that will be used when installing packages.
The files are passed directly to the corresponding package manager and
should be written in the format expected by the package manager of the
image\[cq]s distro.
.TP
\f[V]Architecture=\f[R], \f[V]--architecture=\f[R]
The architecture to build the image for.
Note that this currently only works for architectures compatible with
the host\[cq]s architecture.
.SS [Output] Section
.TP
\f[V]Format=\f[R], \f[V]--format=\f[R], \f[V]-t\f[R]
The image format type to generate.
One of \f[V]directory\f[R] (for generating OS images inside a local
directory), \f[V]subvolume\f[R] (similar, but as a btrfs subvolume),
\f[V]tar\f[R] (similar, but a tarball of the image is generated),
\f[V]cpio\f[R] (similar, but a cpio archive is generated),
\f[V]disk\f[R] (a block device image with a GPT partition table).
.TP
\f[V]ManifestFormat=\f[R], \f[V]--manifest-format=\f[R]
The manifest format type or types to generate.
A comma-delimited list consisting of \f[V]json\f[R] (the standard JSON
output format that describes the packages installed),
\f[V]changelog\f[R] (a human-readable text format designed for diffing).
Defaults to \f[V]json\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]Output=\f[R], \f[V]--output=\f[R], \f[V]-o\f[R]
Path for the output image file to generate.
Takes a relative or absolute path where the generated image will be
placed.
If neither this option nor \f[V]OutputDirectory=\f[R] is used, the image
is generated under the name \f[V]image\f[R], but its name suffixed with
an appropriate file suffix (e.g.\ \f[V]image.raw.xz\f[R] in case
\f[V]gpt_ext4\f[R] is used in combination with \f[V]xz\f[R]
compression).
If the \f[V]ImageId=\f[R] option is configured it is used instead of
\f[V]image\f[R] in the default output name.
If an image version is specified via \f[V]ImageVersion=\f[R], it is
included in the default name, e.g.\ a specified image version of
\f[V]7.8\f[R] might result in an image file name of
\f[V]image_7.8.raw.xz\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]OutputDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--output-dir=\f[R], \f[V]-O\f[R]
Path to a directory where to place all generated artifacts (i.e.\ the
generated image when an output path is not given, \f[V]SHA256SUMS\f[R]
file, etc.).
If this is not specified and the directory \f[V]mkosi.output/\f[R]
exists in the local directory, it is automatically used for this
purpose.
If the setting is not used and \f[V]mkosi.output/\f[R] does not exist,
all output artifacts are placed adjacent to the output image file.
If an output directory is configured, mkosi will create
\f[V]distro\[ti]release\f[R] subdirectories in it to store the
artfifacts per distro, release combination that\[cq]s built.
.TP
\f[V]WorkspaceDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--workspace-dir=\f[R]
Path to a directory where to store data required temporarily while
building the image.
This directory should have enough space to store the full OS image,
though in most modes the actually used disk space is smaller.
If not specified, and \f[V]mkosi.workspace/\f[R] exists in the local
directory, it is used for this purpose.
Otherwise, hidden subdirectories of the current working directory are
used.
The data in this directory is removed automatically after each build.
It\[cq]s safe to manually remove the contents of this directory should
an \f[V]mkosi\f[R] invocation be aborted abnormally (for example, due to
reboot/power failure).
.TP
\f[V]Force=\f[R], \f[V]--force\f[R], \f[V]-f\f[R]
Replace the output file if it already exists, when building an image.
By default when building an image and an output artifact already exists
\f[V]mkosi\f[R] will refuse operation.
Specify this option once to delete all build artifacts from a previous
run before re-building the image.
If incremental builds are enabled, specifying this option twice will
ensure the intermediary cache files are removed, too, before the
re-build is initiated.
If a package cache is used (also see the \[lq]Files\[rq] section below),
specifying this option thrice will ensure the package cache is removed
too, before the re-build is initiated.
For the \f[V]clean\f[R] operation this option has a slightly different
effect: by default the verb will only remove build artifacts from a
previous run, when specified once the incremental cache files are
deleted too, and when specified twice the package cache is also removed.
.PP
.TP
\f[V]Bootable=\f[R], \f[V]--bootable=\f[R]
Takes a boolean or \f[V]auto\f[R].
Enables or disable generating of a bootable image.
If enabled, mkosi will install systemd-boot, run kernel-install,
generate unified kernel images for installed kernels and add an ESP
partition when the disk image output is used.
If systemd-boot is not installed or no kernel images can be found, the
build will fail.
\f[V]auto\f[R] behaves as if the option was enabled, but the build
won\[cq]t fail if either no kernel images or systemd-boot can\[cq]t be
found.
If disabled, systemd-boot won\[cq]t be installed even if found inside
the image, kernel-install won\[cq]t be executed, no unified kernel
images will be generated and no ESP partition will be added to the image
if the disk output format is used.
.TP
\f[V]KernelCommandLine=\f[R], \f[V]--kernel-command-line=\f[R]
Use the specified kernel command line when building images.
By default command line arguments get appended.
To remove all arguments from the current list pass \[lq]!*\[rq].
To remove specific arguments add a space separated list of \[lq]!\[rq]
prefixed arguments.
For example adding \[lq]!* console=ttyS0 rw\[rq] to a
\f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] file or the command line arguments passes
\[lq]console=ttyS0 rw\[rq] to the kernel in any case.
Just adding \[lq]console=ttyS0 rw\[rq] would append these two arguments
to the kernel command line created by lower priority configuration files
or previous \f[V]KernelCommandLine=\f[R] command line arguments.
.TP
\f[V]SecureBoot=\f[R], \f[V]--secure-boot\f[R]
Sign the resulting kernel/initrd image for UEFI SecureBoot.
.TP
\f[V]SecureBootKey=\f[R], \f[V]--secure-boot-key=\f[R]
Path to the PEM file containing the secret key for signing the UEFI
kernel image, if \f[V]SecureBoot=\f[R] is used.
.TP
\f[V]SecureBootCertificate=\f[R], \f[V]--secure-boot-certificate=\f[R]
Path to the X.509 file containing the certificate for the signed UEFI
kernel image, if \f[V]SecureBoot=\f[R] is used.
.TP
\f[V]SecureBootCommonName=\f[R], \f[V]--secure-boot-common-name=\f[R]
Common name to be used when generating SecureBoot keys via mkosi\[cq]s
\f[V]genkey\f[R] command.
Defaults to \f[V]mkosi of %u\f[R], where \f[V]%u\f[R] expands to the
username of the user invoking mkosi.
.TP
\f[V]SecureBootValidDays=\f[R], \f[V]--secure-boot-valid-days=\f[R]
Number of days that the keys should remain valid when generating
SecureBoot keys via mkosi\[cq]s \f[V]genkey\f[R] command.
Defaults to two years (730 days).
.TP
\f[V]SignExpectedPCR=\f[R], \f[V]--sign-expected-pcr\f[R]
Measure the components of the unified kernel image (UKI) using
\f[V]systemd-measure\f[R] and embed the PCR signature into the unified
kernel image.
This option takes a boolean value or the special value \f[V]auto\f[R],
which is the default, which is equal to a true value if the
\f[V]cryptography\f[R] (https://cryptography.io/) module is importable
and the \f[V]systemd-measure\f[R] binary is in \f[V]PATH\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]CompressOutput=\f[R], \f[V]--compress-output=\f[R]
Configure compression for the resulting image or archive.
The argument can be either a boolean or a compression algorithm
(\f[V]xz\f[R], \f[V]zstd\f[R]).
\f[V]xz\f[R] compression is used by default.
Note that when applied to block device image types this means the image
cannot be started directly but needs to be decompressed first.
This also means that the \f[V]shell\f[R], \f[V]boot\f[R], \f[V]qemu\f[R]
verbs are not available when this option is used.
Implied for \f[V]tar\f[R] and \f[V]cpio\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]ImageVersion=\f[R], \f[V]--image-version=\f[R]
Configure the image version.
This accepts any string, but it is recommended to specify a series of
dot separated components.
The version may also be configured in a file \f[V]mkosi.version\f[R] in
which case it may be conveniently managed via the \f[V]bump\f[R] verb or
the \f[V]--auto-bump\f[R] option.
When specified the image version is included in the default output file
name, i.e.\ instead of \f[V]image.raw\f[R] the default will be
\f[V]image_0.1.raw\f[R] for version \f[V]0.1\f[R] of the image, and
similar.
The version is also passed via the \f[V]$IMAGE_VERSION\f[R] to any build
scripts invoked (which may be useful to patch it into
\f[V]/etc/os-release\f[R] or similar, in particular the
\f[V]IMAGE_VERSION=\f[R] field of it).
.TP
\f[V]AutoBump=\f[R], \f[V]--auto-bump=\f[R], \f[V]-B\f[R]
If specified, after each successful build the the version is bumped in a
fashion equivalent to the \f[V]bump\f[R] verb, in preparation for the
next build.
This is useful for simple, linear version management: each build in a
series will have a version number one higher then the previous one.
.TP
\f[V]ImageId=\f[R], \f[V]--image-id=\f[R]
Configure the image identifier.
This accepts a freeform string that shall be used to identify the image
with.
If set the default output file will be named after it (possibly suffixed
with the version).
If this option is used the root, \f[V]/usr/\f[R] and Verity partitions
in the image will have their labels set to this (possibly suffixed by
the image version).
The identifier is also passed via the \f[V]$IMAGE_ID\f[R] to any build
scripts invoked (which may be useful to patch it into
\f[V]/etc/os-release\f[R] or similar, in particular the
\f[V]IMAGE_ID=\f[R] field of it).
.TP
\f[V]CacheInitrd=\f[R], \f[V]--cache-initrd\f[R]
If specified, and incremental mode is used, mkosi will build the initrd
in the cache image and reuse it in the final image.
Note that this means that any changes that are only applied to the final
image and not the cached image won\[cq]t be included in the initrd.
.TP
\f[V]SplitArtifacts=\f[R], \f[V]--split-artifacts\f[R]
If specified and building a disk image, pass \f[V]--split=yes\f[R] to
systemd-repart to have it write out split partition files for each
configured partition.
Read the
man (https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-repart.html#--split=BOOL)
page for more information.
This is useful in A/B update scenarios where an existing disk image
shall be augmented with a new version of a root or \f[V]/usr\f[R]
partition along with its Verity partition and unified kernel.
.TP
\f[V]RepartDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--repart-dir=\f[R]
Path to a directory containing systemd-repart partition definition files
that are used when mkosi invokes systemd-repart when building a disk
image.
If not specified and \f[V]mkosi.repart/\f[R] exists in the local
directory, it will be used instead.
Note that mkosi invokes repart with \f[V]--root=\f[R] set to the root of
the image root, so any \f[V]CopyFiles=\f[R] source paths in partition
definition files will be relative to the image root directory.
.TP
\f[V]TarStripSELinuxContext=\f[R], \f[V]--tar-strip-selinux-context\f[R]
If running on a SELinux-enabled system (Fedora Linux, CentOS, Rocky
Linux, Alma Linux), files inside the container are tagged with SELinux
context extended attributes (\f[V]xattrs\f[R]), which may interfere with
host SELinux rules in building or further container import stages.
This option strips SELinux context attributes from the resulting tar
archive.
.TP
\f[V]Initrd=\f[R], \f[V]--initrd\f[R]
Use user-provided initrd(s).
Takes a comma separated list of paths to initrd files.
This option may be used multiple times in which case the initrd lists
are combined.
.SS [Content] Section
.TP
\f[V]Packages=\f[R], \f[V]--package=\f[R], \f[V]-p\f[R]
Install the specified distribution packages (i.e.\ RPM, DEB, \&...)
in the image.
Takes a comma separated list of package specifications.
This option may be used multiple times in which case the specified
package lists are combined.
Packages specified this way will be installed both in the development
and the final image.
Use \f[V]BuildPackages=\f[R] to specify packages that shall only be used
for the image generated in the build image, but that shall not appear in
the final image.
The types and syntax of \[lq]package specifications\[rq] that are
allowed depend on the package installer (e.g.\ \f[V]dnf\f[R] or
\f[V]yum\f[R] for \f[V]rpm\f[R]-based distros or \f[V]apt\f[R] for
\f[V]deb\f[R]-based distros), but may include package names, package
names with version and/or architecture, package name globs, paths to
packages in the file system, package groups, and virtual provides,
including file paths.
To remove a package e.g.\ added by a \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] configuration
file prepend the package name with \f[V]!\f[R].
For example -p \[lq]!apache2\[rq] would remove the apache2 package.
To replace the apache2 package by the httpd package just add -p
\[lq]!apache2,httpd\[rq] to the command line arguments.
To remove all packages use \[lq]!*\[rq].
Example: when using an distro that uses \f[V]dnf\f[R],
\f[V]Packages=meson libfdisk-devel.i686 git-* prebuilt/rpms/systemd-249-rc1.local.rpm /usr/bin/ld \[at]development-tools python3dist(mypy)\f[R]
would install the \f[V]meson\f[R] package (in the latest version), the
32-bit version of the \f[V]libfdisk-devel\f[R] package, all available
packages that start with the \f[V]git-\f[R] prefix, a \f[V]systemd\f[R]
rpm from the local file system, one of the packages that provides
\f[V]/usr/bin/ld\f[R], the packages in the \[lq]Development Tools\[rq]
group, and the package that contains the \f[V]mypy\f[R] python module.
.TP
\f[V]WithDocs=\f[R], \f[V]--with-docs\f[R]
Include documentation in the image built.
By default if the underlying distribution package manager supports it
documentation is not included in the image built.
The \f[V]$WITH_DOCS\f[R] environment variable passed to the
\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script indicates whether this option was used or
not.
.TP
\f[V]WithTests=\f[R], \f[V]--without-tests\f[R], \f[V]-T\f[R]
If set to false (or when the command-line option is used), the
\f[V]$WITH_TESTS\f[R] environment variable is set to \f[V]0\f[R] when
the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script is invoked.
This is supposed to be used by the build script to bypass any unit or
integration tests that are normally run during the source build process.
Note that this option has no effect unless the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R]
build script honors it.
.TP
\f[V]CacheDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--cache-dir=\f[R]
Takes a path to a directory to use as package cache for the distribution
package manager used.
If this option is not used, but a \f[V]mkosi.cache/\f[R] directory is
found in the local directory it is automatically used for this purpose.
The directory configured this way is mounted into both the development
and the final image while the package manager is running.
.TP
\f[V]SkeletonTree=\f[R], \f[V]--skeleton-tree=\f[R]
Takes a colon separated pair of paths.
The first path refers to a directory to copy into the OS tree before
invoking the package manager.
The second path refers to the target directory inside the image.
If the second path is not provided, the directory is copied on top of
the root directory of the image.
Use this to insert files and directories into the OS tree before the
package manager installs any packages.
If this option is not used, but the \f[V]mkosi.skeleton/\f[R] directory
is found in the local directory it is automatically used for this
purpose with the root directory as target (also see the \[lq]Files\[rq]
section below).
Instead of a directory, a tar file may be provided.
In this case it is unpacked into the OS tree before the package manager
is invoked.
This mode of operation allows setting permissions and file ownership
explicitly, in particular for projects stored in a version control
system such as \f[V]git\f[R] which retain full file ownership and access
mode metadata for committed files.
If the tar file \f[V]mkosi.skeleton.tar\f[R] is found in the local
directory it will be automatically used for this purpose.
.TP
\f[V]ExtraTree=\f[R], \f[V]--extra-tree=\f[R]
Takes a colon separated pair of paths.
The first path refers to a directory to copy from the host into the
image.
The second path refers to the target directory inside the image.
If the second path is not provided, the directory is copied on top of
the root directory of the image.
Use this to override any default configuration files shipped with the
distribution.
If this option is not used, but the \f[V]mkosi.extra/\f[R] directory is
found in the local directory it is automatically used for this purpose
with the root directory as target.
(also see the \[lq]Files\[rq] section below).
As with the skeleton tree logic above, instead of a directory, a tar
file may be provided too.
\f[V]mkosi.skeleton.tar\f[R] will be automatically used if found in the
local directory.
.TP
\f[V]CleanPackageMetadata=\f[R], \f[V]--clean-package-metadata=\f[R]
Enable/disable removal of package manager databases, caches, and logs at
the end of installation.
Can be specified as true, false, or \[lq]\f[V]auto\f[R]\[rq] (the
default).
With \[lq]\f[V]auto\f[R]\[rq], files will be removed if the respective
package manager executable is \f[I]not\f[R] present at the end of the
installation.
.TP
\f[V]RemoveFiles=\f[R], \f[V]--remove-files=\f[R]
Takes a comma-separated list of globs.
Files in the image matching the globs will be purged at the end.
.TP
\f[V]RemovePackages=\f[R], \f[V]--remove-package=\f[R]
Takes a comma-separated list of package specifications for removal, in
the same format as \f[V]Packages=\f[R].
The removal will be performed as one of the last steps.
This step is skipped if \f[V]CleanPackageMetadata=no\f[R] is used.
This option is currently only implemented for distributions using
\f[V]dnf\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]Environment=\f[R], \f[V]--environment=\f[R]
Adds variables to the environment that the
build/prepare/postinstall/finalize scripts are executed with.
Takes a space-separated list of variable assignments or just variable
names.
In the latter case, the values of those variables will be passed through
from the environment in which \f[V]mkosi\f[R] was invoked.
This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed
variables will be set.
If the same variable is set twice, the later setting overrides the
earlier one.
.TP
\f[V]BuildSources=\f[R], \f[V]--build-sources=\f[R]
Takes a path to a source tree to mount into the development image, if
the build script is used.
.TP
\f[V]BuildDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--build-dir=\f[R]
Takes a path of a directory to use as build directory for build systems
that support out-of-tree builds (such as Meson).
The directory used this way is shared between repeated builds, and
allows the build system to reuse artifacts (such as object files,
executable, \&...)
generated on previous invocations.
This directory is mounted into the development image when the build
script is invoked.
The build script can find the path to this directory in the
\f[V]$BUILDDIR\f[R] environment variable.
If this option is not specified, but a directory
\f[V]mkosi.builddir/\f[R] exists in the local directory it is
automatically used for this purpose (also see the \[lq]Files\[rq]
section below).
.TP
\f[V]InstallDirectory=\f[R], \f[V]--install-dir=\f[R]
Takes a path of a directory to use as the install directory.
The directory used this way is shared between builds and allows the
build system to not have to reinstall files that were already installed
by a previous build and didn\[cq]t change.
The build script can find the path to this directory in the
\f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] environment variable.
If this option is not specified, but a directory
\f[V]mkosi.installdir\f[R] exists in the local directory, it is
automatically used for this purpose (also see the \[lq]Files\[rq]
section below).
.TP
\f[V]BuildPackages=\f[R], \f[V]--build-package=\f[R]
Similar to \f[V]Packages=\f[R], but configures packages to install only
in the first phase of the build, into the development image.
This option should be used to list packages containing header files,
compilers, build systems, linkers and other build tools the
\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script requires to operate.
Note that packages listed here are only included in the image created
during the first phase of the build, and are absent in the final image.
Use \f[V]Packages=\f[R] to list packages that shall be included in both.
Packages are appended to the list.
Packages prefixed with \[lq]!\[rq] are removed from the list.
\[lq]!*\[rq] removes all packages from the list.
.TP
\f[V]Password=\f[R], \f[V]--password=\f[R]
Set the password of the \f[V]root\f[R] user.
By default the \f[V]root\f[R] account is locked.
If this option is not used, but a file \f[V]mkosi.rootpw\f[R] exists in
the local directory, the root password is automatically read from it.
.TP
\f[V]PasswordIsHashed=\f[R], \f[V]--password-is-hashed\f[R]
Indicate that the password supplied for the \f[V]root\f[R] user has
already been hashed, so that the string supplied with
\f[V]Password=\f[R] or \f[V]mkosi.rootpw\f[R] will be written to
\f[V]/etc/shadow\f[R] literally.
.TP
\f[V]Autologin=\f[R], \f[V]--autologin\f[R]
Enable autologin for the \f[V]root\f[R] user on \f[V]/dev/pts/0\f[R]
(nspawn), \f[V]/dev/tty1\f[R] and \f[V]/dev/hvc0\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]BuildScript=\f[R], \f[V]--build-script=\f[R]
Takes a path to an executable that is used as build script for this
image.
The specified script is copied onto the development image and executed
inside a namespaced chroot environment.
If this option is not used, but the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] file found in
the local directory it is automatically used for this purpose (also see
the \[lq]Files\[rq] section below).
Specify an empty value to disable automatic detection.
.TP
\f[V]PrepareScript=\f[R], \f[V]--prepare-script=\f[R]
Takes a path to an executable that is invoked inside the image right
after installing the software packages.
It is the last step before the image is cached (if incremental mode is
enabled).
This script is invoked inside a namespaced chroot environment, and thus
does not have access to host resources.
If this option is not used, but an executable script
\f[V]mkosi.prepare\f[R] is found in the local directory, it is
automatically used for this purpose.
Specify an empty value to disable automatic detection.
.TP
\f[V]PostInstallationScript=\f[R], \f[V]--postinst-script=\f[R]
Takes a path to an executable that is invoked inside the final image
right after copying in the build artifacts generated in the first phase
of the build.
This script is invoked inside a namespaced chroot environment, and thus
does not have access to host resources.
If this option is not used, but an executable \f[V]mkosi.postinst\f[R]
is found in the local directory, it is automatically used for this
purpose.
Specify an empty value to disable automatic detection.
.TP
\f[V]FinalizeScript=\f[R], \f[V]--finalize-script=\f[R]
Takes a path to an executable that is invoked outside the final image
right after copying in the build artifacts generated in the first phase
of the build, and after having executed the \f[V]mkosi.postinst\f[R]
script (see \f[V]PostInstallationScript=\f[R]).
This script is invoked directly in the host environment, and hence has
full access to the host\[cq]s resources.
If this option is not used, but an executable \f[V]mkosi.finalize\f[R]
is found in the local directory, it is automatically used for this
purpose.
Specify an empty value to disable automatic detection.
.TP
\f[V]WithNetwork=\f[R], \f[V]--with-network=\f[R]
When true, enables network connectivity while the build script
\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] is invoked.
By default, the build script runs with networking turned off.
The \f[V]$WITH_NETWORK\f[R] environment variable is passed to the
\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] build script indicating whether the build is done
with or without network.
.TP
\f[V]CacheOnly=\f[R], \f[V]--cache-only=\f[R]
If specified, the package manager is instructed not to contact the
network for updating package data.
This provides a minimal level of reproducibility, as long as the package
data cache is already fully populated.
.TP
\f[V]Settings=\f[R], \f[V]--settings=\f[R]
Specifies a \f[V].nspawn\f[R] settings file for \f[V]systemd-nspawn\f[R]
to use in the \f[V]boot\f[R] and \f[V]shell\f[R] verbs, and to place
next to the generated image file.
This is useful to configure the \f[V]systemd-nspawn\f[R] environment
when the image is run.
If this setting is not used but an \f[V]mkosi.nspawn\f[R] file found in
the local directory it is automatically used for this purpose.
.TP
\f[V]BaseImage=\f[R], \f[V]--base-image=\f[R]
Use the specified directory or file system image as the base image, and
create the output image that consists only of changes from this base.
The base image is attached as the lower file system in an overlayfs
structure, and the output filesystem becomes the upper layer, initially
empty.
Thus files that are not modified compared to the base image are not
present in the output image.
This option may be used to create systemd \[lq]system extensions\[rq] or
portable services.
See https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES/#extension-images for more
information.
.SS [Validation] Section
.TP
\f[V]Checksum=\f[R], \f[V]--checksum\f[R]
Generate a \f[V]SHA256SUMS\f[R] file of all generated artifacts after
the build is complete.
.TP
\f[V]Sign=\f[R], \f[V]--sign\f[R]
Sign the generated \f[V]SHA256SUMS\f[R] using \f[V]gpg\f[R] after
completion.
.TP
\f[V]Key=\f[R], \f[V]--key=\f[R]
Select the \f[V]gpg\f[R] key to use for signing \f[V]SHA256SUMS\f[R].
This key must be already present in the \f[V]gpg\f[R] keyring.
.SS [Host] Section
.TP
\f[V]ExtraSearchPaths=\f[R], \f[V]--extra-search-path=\f[R]
List of colon-separated paths to look for tools in, before using the

.TP
\f[V]QemuGui=\f[R], \f[V]--qemu-gui=\f[R]
If enabled, qemu is executed with its graphical interface instead of
with a serial console.
.TP
\f[V]QemuSmp=\f[R], \f[V]--qemu-smp=\f[R]
When used with the \f[V]qemu\f[R] verb, this options sets
\f[V]qemu\f[R]\[cq]s \f[V]-smp\f[R] argument which controls the number
of guest\[cq]s CPUs.
Defaults to \f[V]2\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]QemuMem=\f[R], \f[V]--qemu-mem=\f[R]
When used with the \f[V]qemu\f[R] verb, this options sets
\f[V]qemu\f[R]\[cq]s \f[V]-m\f[R] argument which controls the amount of
guest\[cq]s RAM.
Defaults to \f[V]1G\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]QemuKvm=\f[R], \f[V]--qemu-kvm=\f[R]
When used with the \f[V]qemu\f[R] verb, this option specifies whether
QEMU should use KVM acceleration.
Defaults to yes if the host machine supports KVM acceleration, no
otherwise.
.TP
\f[V]QemuArgs=\f[R]
Space-delimited list of additional arguments to pass when invoking qemu.
.TP
\f[V]Ephemeral=\f[R], \f[V]--ephemeral\f[R]
When used with the \f[V]shell\f[R], \f[V]boot\f[R], or \f[V]qemu\f[R]
verbs, this option runs the specified verb on a temporary snapshot of
the output image that is removed immediately when the container
terminates.
Taking the temporary snapshot is more efficient on file systems that
support subvolume snapshots or `reflinks' natively (\[lq]btrfs\[rq] or
new \[lq]xfs\[rq]) than on more traditional file systems that do not
(\[lq]ext4\[rq]).
.TP
\f[V]Ssh=\f[R], \f[V]--ssh\f[R]
If specified, an sshd socket unit and matching service are installed in
the final image that expose sshd over VSock.
When building with this option and running the image using
\f[V]mkosi qemu\f[R], the \f[V]mkosi ssh\f[R] command can be used to
connect to the container/VM via SSH.
Note that you still have to make sure openssh is installed in the image
to make this option behave correctly.
Also note that mkosi doesn\[cq]t provision a public SSH key into the
image automatically.
One way to do this is by setting the \f[V]ssh.authorized_keys.root\f[R]
credential using the \f[V]Credential=\f[R] option or by copying it in
using \f[V]ExtraTrees=\f[R].
To access images booted using \f[V]mkosi boot\f[R], use
\f[V]machinectl\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]Credentials=\f[R], \f[V]--credential=\f[R]
Set credentials to be passed to systemd-nspawn or qemu respectively when
\f[V]mkosi shell/boot\f[R] or \f[V]mkosi qemu\f[R] are used.
This option takes a space separated list of key=value assignments.
.TP
\f[V]KernelCommandLineExtra=\f[R], \f[V]--kernel-command-line-extra=\f[R]
Set extra kernel command line entries that are appended to the kernel
command line at runtime when booting the image.
When booting in a container, these are passed as extra arguments to
systemd.
When booting in a VM, these are appended to the kernel command line via
the SMBIOS io.systemd.stub.kernel-cmdline-extra OEM string.
This will only be picked up by systemd-boot/systemd-stub versions newer
than or equal to v254.
.TP
\f[V]Acl=\f[R], \f[V]--acl=\f[R]
If specified, ACLs will be set on any generated root filesystem
directories that allow the user running mkosi to remove them without
needing privileges.
.SS Commandline-only Options
.PP
Those settings cannot be configured in the configuration files.
.TP
\f[V]--directory=\f[R], \f[V]-C\f[R]
Takes a path to a directory.
\f[V]mkosi\f[R] switches to this directory before doing anything.
Note that the various \f[V]mkosi.*\f[R] files are searched for only
after changing to this directory, hence using this option is an
effective way to build a project located in a specific directory.
.TP
\f[V]--config=\f[R]
Loads additional settings from the specified settings file.
Most command line options may also be configured in a settings file.
See the table below to see which command line options match which
settings file option.
If this option is not used, but a file \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] is found in
the local directory it is automatically used for this purpose.
If a setting is configured both on the command line and in the settings
file, the command line generally wins, except for options taking lists
in which case both lists are combined.
.TP
\f[V]--incremental\f[R], \f[V]-i\f[R]
Enable incremental build mode.
This only applies if the two-phase \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] build script
logic is used.
In this mode, a copy of the OS image is created immediately after all OS
packages are unpacked but before the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script is
invoked in the development container.
Similarly, a copy of the final image is created immediately before the
build artifacts from the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script are copied in.
On subsequent invocations of \f[V]mkosi\f[R] with the \f[V]-i\f[R]
switch these cached images may be used to skip the OS package unpacking,
thus drastically speeding up repetitive build times.
Note that when this is used and a pair of cached incremental images
exists they are not automatically regenerated, even if options such as
\f[V]Packages=\f[R] are modified.
In order to force rebuilding of these cached images, combine
\f[V]-i\f[R] with \f[V]-ff\f[R] to ensure cached images are first
removed and then re-created.
.TP
\f[V]--debug=\f[R]
Enable additional debugging output.
Takes a comma-separated list of arguments specifying the area of
interest.
Pass any invalid value (e.g.\ empty) to list currently accepted values.

Any distribution that packages \f[V]dnf\f[R] may be used to build

Any distro that packages \f[V]pacman\f[R] may be used to build \f[I]Arch
Linux\f[R] images.
Any distribution that packages \f[V]zypper\f[R] may be used to build
\f[I]openSUSE\f[R] images.
Any distribution that packages \f[V]emerge\f[R] may be used to build

Currently, \f[I]Fedora Linux\f[R] packages all relevant tools as of
Fedora 28.
.SH Files
.PP
To make it easy to build images for development versions of your
projects, mkosi can read configuration data from the local directory,
under the assumption that it is invoked from a \f[I]source\f[R] tree.
Specifically, the following files are used if they exist in the local
directory:
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.conf\f[B]\f[R] file provides the default
configuration for the image building process.
For example, it may specify the distribution to use (\f[V]fedora\f[R],
\f[V]ubuntu\f[R], \f[V]debian\f[R], \f[V]arch\f[R], \f[V]opensuse\f[R],
\f[V]mageia\f[R], \f[V]openmandriva\f[R], \f[V]gentoo\f[R]) for the
image, or additional distribution packages to install.
Note that all options encoded in this configuration file may also be set
on the command line, and this file is hence little more than a way to
make sure invoking \f[V]mkosi\f[R] without further parameters in your
\f[I]source\f[R] tree is enough to get the right image of your choice
set up.
.RS 2
.PP
Additionally, if a \f[I]\f[VI]mkosi.conf.d/\f[I]\f[R] directory exists,
each file in it is loaded in the same manner adding/overriding the
values specified in \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R].
If \f[V]mkosi.conf.d/\f[R] contains a directory named after the
distribution being built, each file in that directory is also processed.
.PP
The file format is inspired by Windows \f[V].ini\f[R] files and supports
multi-line assignments: any line with initial whitespace is considered a
continuation line of the line before.
Command-line arguments, as shown in the help description, have to be
included in a configuration block (e.g.\ \[lq]\f[V][Content]\f[R]\[rq])
corresponding to the argument group (e.g.\ \[lq]\f[V]Content\f[R]\[rq]),
and the argument gets converted as follows:
\[lq]\f[V]--with-network\f[R]\[rq] becomes
\[lq]\f[V]WithNetwork=yes\f[R]\[rq].
For further details see the table above.

\f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.skeleton.tar\f[B]\f[R] archive may be used to insert
files into the image.
The files are copied \f[I]before\f[R] the distribution packages are
installed into the image.
This allows creation of files that need to be provided early, for
example to configure the package manager or set systemd presets.

The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.extra/\f[B]\f[R] directory or
\f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.extra.tar\f[B]\f[R] archive may be used to insert
additional files into the image, on top of what the distribution
includes in its packages.
They are similar to \f[V]mkosi.skeleton/\f[R] and
\f[V]mkosi.skeleton.tar\f[R], but the files are copied into the
directory tree of the image \f[I]after\f[R] the OS was installed.

\f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.build\f[B]\f[R] may be an executable script.
If it exists, the image will be built twice: the first iteration will be
the \f[I]development\f[R] image, the second iteration will be the
\f[I]final\f[R] image.
The \f[I]development\f[R] image is used to build the project in the
current working directory (the \f[I]source\f[R] tree).
For that the whole directory is copied into the image, along with the
\f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script.
The script is then invoked inside the image, with \f[V]$SRCDIR\f[R]
pointing to the \f[I]source\f[R] tree.
\f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] points to a directory where the script should place
any files generated it would like to end up in the \f[I]final\f[R]
image.
Note that \f[V]make\f[R]/\f[V]automake\f[R]/\f[V]meson\f[R] based build
systems generally honor \f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R], thus making it very natural
to build \f[I]source\f[R] trees from the build script.
After the \f[I]development\f[R] image was built and the build script ran
inside of it, it is removed again.
After that the \f[I]final\f[R] image is built, without any
\f[I]source\f[R] tree or build script copied in.
However, this time the contents of \f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] are added into the
image.
.RS 2
.PP
When the source tree is copied into the \f[I]build\f[R] image, all files
are copied, except for \f[V]mkosi.builddir/\f[R], \f[V]mkosi.cache/\f[R]
and \f[V]mkosi.output/\f[R].
That said, \f[V].gitignore\f[R] is respected if the source tree is a
\f[V]git\f[R] checkout.
If multiple different images shall be built from the same source tree it
is essential to exclude their output files from this copy operation, as
otherwise a version of an image built earlier might be included in a
later build, which is usually not intended.
An alternative to excluding these built images via \f[V].gitignore\f[R]
entries is to use the \f[V]mkosi.output/\f[R] directory, which is an
easy way to exclude all build artifacts.
.PP
The \f[V]$MKOSI_CONFIG\f[R] environment variable will be set inside of
this script so that you know which \f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R] (if any) was
passed in.

.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.prepare\f[B]\f[R] script is invoked directly after
the software packages are installed, from within the image context, if
it exists.
It is once called for the \f[I]development\f[R] image (if this is
enabled, see above) with the \[lq]build\[rq] command line parameter,
right before copying the extra tree.
It is called a second time for the \f[I]final\f[R] image with the
\[lq]final\[rq] command line parameter.
This script has network access and may be used to install packages from
other sources than the distro\[cq]s package manager
(e.g.\ \f[V]pip\f[R], \f[V]npm\f[R], \&...), after all software packages
are installed but before the image is cached (if incremental mode is
enabled).
This script is executed within \f[V]$SRCDIR\f[R].
In contrast to a general purpose installation, it is safe to install
packages to the system (\f[V]pip install\f[R],
\f[V]npm   install -g\f[R]) instead of in \f[V]$SRCDIR\f[R] itself
because the build image is only used for a single project and can easily
be thrown away and rebuilt so there\[cq]s no risk of conflicting
dependencies and no risk of polluting the host system.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.postinst\f[B]\f[R] script is invoked as the
penultimate step of preparing an image, from within the image context,
if it exists.
It is called first for the \f[I]development\f[R] image (if this is
enabled, see above) with the \[lq]build\[rq] command line parameter,
right before invoking the build script.
It is called a second time for the \f[I]final\f[R] image with the
\[lq]final\[rq] command line parameter, right before the image is
considered complete.
This script may be used to alter the images without any restrictions,
after all software packages and built sources have been installed.
Note that this script is executed directly in the image context with the
final root directory in place, without any
\f[V]$SRCDIR\f[R]/\f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] setup.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.finalize\f[B]\f[R] script, if it exists, is invoked
as last step of preparing an image, from the host system.
It is once called for the \f[I]development\f[R] image (if this is
enabled, see above) with the \[lq]build\[rq] command line parameter, as
the last step before invoking the build script, after the
\f[V]mkosi.postinst\f[R] script is invoked.
It is called the second time with the \[lq]final\[rq] command line
parameter as the last step before the image is considered complete.
The environment variable \f[V]$BUILDROOT\f[R] points to the root
directory of the installation image.
Additional verbs may be added in the future, the script should be
prepared for that.
This script may be used to alter the images without any restrictions,
after all software packages and built sources have been installed.
This script is more flexible than \f[V]mkosi.postinst\f[R] in two
regards: it has access to the host file system so it\[cq]s easier to
copy in additional files or to modify the image based on external
configuration, and the script is run in the host, so it can be used even
without emulation even if the image has a foreign architecture.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.nspawn\f[B]\f[R] nspawn settings file will be
copied into the same place as the output image file, if it exists.
This is useful since nspawn looks for settings files next to image files
it boots, for additional container runtime settings.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.cache/\f[B]\f[R] directory, if it exists, is
automatically used as package download cache, in order to speed repeated
runs of the tool.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.builddir/\f[B]\f[R] directory, if it exists, is
automatically used as out-of-tree build directory, if the build commands
in the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] script support it.
Specifically, this directory will be mounted into the build container,
and the \f[V]$BUILDDIR\f[R] environment variable will be set to it when
the build script is invoked.
The build script may then use this directory as build directory, for
automake-style or ninja-style out-of-tree builds.
This speeds up builds considerably, in particular when \f[V]mkosi\f[R]
is used in incremental mode (\f[V]-i\f[R]): not only the disk images,
but also the build tree is reused between subsequent invocations.
Note that if this directory does not exist the \f[V]$BUILDDIR\f[R]
environment variable is not set, and it is up to build script to decide
whether to do in in-tree or an out-of-tree build, and which build
directory to use.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.includedir/\f[B]\f[R] directory, if it exists, is
automatically used as an out-of-tree include directory for header files.
Specifically, it will be mounted in the build container at
\f[V]/usr/include/\f[R] when building the build image and when running
the build script.
After building the (cached) build image, this directory will contain all
the files installed to \f[V]/usr/include\f[R].
Language servers or other tools can use these files to provide a better
editing experience for developers working on a project.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.installdir/\f[B]\f[R] directory, if it exists, is
automatically used as the install directory.
Specifically, this directory will be mounted into the container at
\f[V]/root/dest\f[R] when running the build script.
After running the build script, the contents of this directory are
installed into the final image.
This is useful to cache the install step of the build.
If used, subsequent builds will only have to reinstall files that have
changed since the previous build.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.rootpw\f[B]\f[R] file can be used to provide the
password or hashed password (if \f[V]--password-is-hashed\f[R] is set)
for the root user of the image.
The password may optionally be followed by a newline character which is
implicitly removed.
The file must have an access mode of 0600 or less.
If this file does not exist, the distribution\[cq]s default root
password is set (which usually means access to the root user is
blocked).
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.passphrase\f[B]\f[R] file provides the passphrase
to use when LUKS encryption is selected.
It should contain the passphrase literally, and not end in a newline
character (i.e.\ in the same format as cryptsetup and
\f[V]/etc/crypttab\f[R] expect the passphrase files).
The file must have an access mode of 0600 or less.
If this file does not exist and encryption is requested, the user is
queried instead.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.secure-boot.crt\f[B]\f[R] and
\f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.secure-boot.key\f[B]\f[R] files contain an X.509
certificate and PEM private key to use when UEFI SecureBoot support is
enabled.
All EFI binaries included in the image\[cq]s ESP are signed with this
key, as a late step in the build process.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.output/\f[B]\f[R] directory will be used for all
build artifacts, if the image output path is not configured (i.e.\ no
\f[V]--output=\f[R] setting specified), or configured to a filename
(i.e.\ a path containing no \f[V]/\f[R] character).
This includes the image itself, the root hash file in case Verity is
used, the checksum and its signature if that\[cq]s enabled, and the
nspawn settings file if there is any.
Note that this directory is not used if the image output path contains
at least one slash, and has no effect in that case.
This setting is particularly useful if multiple different images shall
be built from the same working directory, as otherwise the build result
of a preceding run might be copied into a build image as part of the
source tree (see above).
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.reposdir/\f[B]\f[R] directory, if it exists, is
automatically used as the repository directory for extra repository
files.
See the \f[V]RepositoryDirectories\f[R] option for more information.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\f[VB]mkosi.credentials/\f[B]\f[R] directory is used as a
source of extra credentials similar to the \f[V]Credentials=\f[R]
option.
For each file in the directory, the filename will be used as the
credential name and the file contents become the credential value, or,
if the file is executable, mkosi will execute the file and the
command\[cq]s output to stdout will be used as the credential value.
Output to stderr will be ignored.
Credentials configured with \f[V]Credentials=\f[R] take precedence over
files in \f[V]mkosi.credentials\f[R].
.PP
All these files are optional.
.PP
Note that the location of all these files may also be configured during
invocation via command line switches, and as settings in
\f[V]mkosi.conf\f[R], in case the default settings are not acceptable
for a project.
.SH CACHING
.PP
\f[V]mkosi\f[R] supports three different caches for speeding up
repetitive re-building of images.
Specifically:
.IP "1." 3
The package cache of the distribution package manager may be cached
between builds.
This is configured with the \f[V]--cache-dir=\f[R] option or the
\f[V]mkosi.cache/\f[R] directory.
This form of caching relies on the distribution\[cq]s package manager,
and caches distribution packages (RPM, DEB, \&...)
after they are downloaded, but before they are unpacked.
.IP "2." 3
If the incremental build mode is enabled with \f[V]--incremental\f[R],
cached copies of the final image and build overlay are made immediately
before the build sources are copied in (for the build overlay) or the
artifacts generated by \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] are copied in (in case of
the final image).
This form of caching allows bypassing the time-consuming package
unpacking step of the distribution package managers, but is only
effective if the list of packages to use remains stable, but the build
sources and its scripts change regularly.
Note that this cache requires manual flushing: whenever the package list
is modified the cached images need to be explicitly removed before the
next re-build, using the \f[V]-f\f[R] switch.
.IP "3." 3
Finally, between multiple builds the build artifact directory may be
shared, using the \f[V]mkosi.builddir/\f[R] directory.
This directory allows build systems such as Meson to reuse already
compiled sources from a previous built, thus speeding up the build
process of the \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] build script.
.PP
The package cache (i.e.\ the first item above) is unconditionally
useful.
The latter two caches only apply to uses of \f[V]mkosi\f[R] with a
source tree and build script.
When all three are enabled together turn-around times for complete image
builds are minimal, as only changed source files need to be recompiled:
an OS image rebuilt will be almost as quick to build the source tree
only.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
The build script \f[V]mkosi.build\f[R] receives the following
environment variables:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$SRCDIR\f[R] contains the path to the sources to build.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] is a directory into which any artifacts generated by
the build script shall be placed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$BUILDDIR\f[R] is only defined if \f[V]mkosi.builddir\f[R] and
points to the build directory to use.
This is useful for all build systems that support out-of-tree builds to
reuse already built artifacts from previous runs.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$WITH_DOCS\f[R] is either \f[V]0\f[R] or \f[V]1\f[R] depending on
whether a build without or with installed documentation was requested
(\f[V]WithDocs=yes\f[R]).
The build script should suppress installation of any package
documentation to \f[V]$DESTDIR\f[R] in case \f[V]$WITH_DOCS\f[R] is set
to \f[V]0\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$WITH_TESTS\f[R] is either \f[V]0\f[R]or \f[V]1\f[R] depending on
whether a build without or with running the test suite was requested
(\f[V]WithTests=no\f[R]).
The build script should avoid running any unit or integration tests in
case \f[V]$WITH_TESTS\f[R] is \f[V]0\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$WITH_NETWORK\f[R] is either \f[V]0\f[R]or \f[V]1\f[R] depending on
whether a build without or with networking is being executed
(\f[V]WithNetwork=no\f[R]).
The build script should avoid any network communication in case
\f[V]$WITH_NETWORK\f[R] is \f[V]0\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]$MKOSI_LESS\f[R] overrides options for \f[V]less\f[R] when it is
invoked by \f[V]mkosi\f[R] to page output.

.SS Different ways to boot with \f[V]qemu\f[R]
.PP
The easiest way to boot a virtual machine is to build an image with the
required components and let \f[V]mkosi\f[R] call \f[V]qemu\f[R] with all
the right options:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ mkosi -d fedora \[rs]
    --autologin \[rs]
    -p systemd-udev,systemd-boot,dracut,kernel-core \[rs]
    build
$ mkosi -d fedora qemu
\&...
fedora login: root (automatic login)
[root\[at]fedora \[ti]]#
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The default is to boot with a text console only.
To boot with a graphical window, add \f[V]--qemu-qui\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ mkosi -d fedora --qemu-gui qemu
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A kernel may be booted directly with
\f[V]mkosi qemu -kernel ... -initrd ... -append \[aq]...\[aq]\f[R].
This is a bit faster because no boot loader is used, and it is also
easier to experiment with different kernels and kernel commandlines.
Note that despite the name, qemu\[cq]s \f[V]-append\f[R] option replaces
the default kernel commandline embedded in the kernel and any previous
\f[V]-append\f[R] specifications.
.PP
\f[V]mkosi\f[R] builds a Unified Kernel Image (UKI).
It is also copied into the output directory and may be booted directly:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ mkosi qemu -kernel mkosi.output/fedora\[ti]38/image.efi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When booting using an external kernel, we don\[cq]t need the kernel
\f[I]in\f[R] the image, but we would still want the kernel modules to be
installed.
.PP
It is also possible to do a \[lq]direct kernel boot\[rq] into a boot
loader, taking advantage of the fact that \f[V]systemd-boot(7)\f[R] is a
valid UEFI binary:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ mkosi qemu -kernel /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this scenario, the kernel is loaded from the ESP in the image by
\f[V]systemd-boot\f[R].
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.PP
mkosi is packaged for various distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux,
Fedora Linux, OpenMandriva, Gentoo.
It is usually easiest to use the distribution package.
.PP
The latest code from git requires systemd 253.
.PP
When not using distribution packages make sure to install the necessary
dependencies.
For example, on \f[I]Fedora Linux\f[R] you need:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# dnf install bubblewrap btrfs-progs apt dosfstools mtools edk2-ovmf e2fsprogs squashfs-tools gnupg python3 tar xfsprogs xz zypper sbsigntools
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
On Debian/Ubuntu it might be necessary to install the
\f[V]ubuntu-keyring\f[R], \f[V]ubuntu-archive-keyring\f[R] and/or
\f[V]debian-archive-keyring\f[R] packages explicitly, in addition to
\f[V]apt\f[R], depending on what kind of distribution images you want to
build.
.PP
Note that the minimum required Python version is 3.9.
