# DESCRIPTION

`mkosi` is a tool for easily building customized OS images. It's a
fancy wrapper around `dnf --installroot`, `debootstrap`, `pacman`
and `zypper` that may generate disk images with a number of bells and
whistles.

## Command Line Verbs

The following command line verbs are known:

`summary`

: Outputs a human-readable summary of all options used for building an
  image. This will parse the command line and `mkosi.conf` file as it
  would do on `build`, but only output what it is configured for and not
  actually build anything.`

`build`

: This builds the image based on the settings passed in on the command line or
  read from a `mkosi.conf` file. This command is the default if no verb is
  explicitly specified. This command must be executed as `root`. Any arguments
  passed after the `build` verb are passed as arguments to the build script (if
  there is one).

`shell`

: This builds the image if it is not built yet, and then invokes
  `systemd-nspawn` to acquire an interactive shell prompt in it. An optional
  command line may be specified after the `shell` verb, to be invoked in place
  of the shell in the container. Use `-f` in order to rebuild the image
  unconditionally before acquiring the shell, see below. This command must be
  executed as `root`.

`boot`

: Similar to `shell`, but boots the image using `systemd-nspawn`. An optional
  command line may be specified after the `boot` verb, which is then passed as
  the "kernel command line" to the init system in the image.

`qemu`

: Similar to `boot`, but uses `qemu` to boot up the image, i.e. instead of
  container virtualization virtual machine virtualization is used. This verb is
  only supported for images that contain a boot loader, i.e. those built with
  `Bootable=yes` (see below). This command must be executed as `root` unless
  the image already exists and `-f` is not specified. Any options specified
  after the `qemu` verb are appended to the `qemu` invocation.

`ssh`

: When the image is built with the `Ssh=yes` option, this command connects
  to a booted (`boot`, `qemu` verbs) container or VM via SSH. Make sure to
  run `mkosi ssh` with the same config as `mkosi build` was run with so
  that it has the necessary information available to connect to the running
  container/VM via SSH. Any arguments passed after the `ssh` verb are passed as
  arguments to the `ssh` invocation.

`clean`

: Remove build artifacts generated on a previous build. If combined
  with `-f`, also removes incremental build cache images. If `-f` is
  specified twice, also removes any package cache.

`serve`

: This builds the image if it is not built yet, and then serves the
  output directory (i.e. usually `mkosi.output/`, see below) via a
  small embedded HTTP server, listening on port 8081. Combine with
  `-f` in order to rebuild the image unconditionally before serving
  it. This command is useful for testing network based acquisition of
  OS images, for example via `machinectl pull-raw …` and `machinectl
  pull-tar …`.

`bump`

: Determines the current image version string (as configured with
  `ImageVersion=`/`--image-version=`), increases its last
  dot-separated component by one and writes the resulting version
  string to `mkosi.version`. This is useful for implementing a simple
  versioning scheme: each time this verb is called the version is
  bumped in preparation for the subsequent build. Note that
  `--auto-bump`/`-B` may be used to automatically bump the version
  after each successful build.

`genkey`

: Generate a pair of SecureBoot keys for usage with the
  `SecureBootKey=`/`--secure-boot-key=` and
  `SecureBootCertificate=`/`--secure-boot-certificate=` options.

`help`

: This verb is equivalent to the `--help` switch documented below: it
  shows a brief usage explanation.

## Execution flow

Execution flow for `mkosi build`. Columns represent the execution context.
Default values/calls are shown in parentheses.
When building with `--incremental` mkosi creates a cache of the distribution
installation for both images if not already existing and replaces the
distribution installation in consecutive runs with data from the cached one.

## Supported output formats

The following output formats are supported:

* Raw *GPT* disk image, created using systemd-repart

* Plain directory, containing the OS tree (*directory*)

* btrfs subvolume

* Tar archive (*tar*)

* CPIO archive (*cpio*) in the format appropriate for a kernel initrd

When a *GPT* disk image is created, repart partition definition files
may be placed in `mkosi.repart/` to configure the generated disk image.

## Configuration Settings

The following settings can be set through configuration files (the
syntax with `SomeSetting=value`) and on the command line (the syntax
with `--some-setting=value`). For some command line parameters, a
single-letter shortcut is also allowed. In the configuration files,
the setting must be in the appropriate section, so the settings are
grouped by section below.

Command line options that take no argument are shown without "=" in
their long version. In the config files, they should be specified with
a boolean argument: either "1", "yes", or "true" to enable, or "0",
"no", "false" to disable.

### [Distribution] Section

`Distribution=`, `--distribution=`, `-d`

: The distribution to install in the image. Takes one of the following
  arguments: `fedora`, `debian`, `ubuntu`, `arch`, `opensuse`, `mageia`,
  `centos`, `openmandriva`, `rocky`, and `alma`. If not specified,
  defaults to the distribution of the host.

`Release=`, `--release=`, `-r`

: The release of the distribution to install in the image. The precise
  syntax of the argument this takes depends on the distribution used,
  and is either a numeric string (in case of Fedora Linux, CentOS, …,
  e.g. `29`), or a distribution version name (in case of Debian,
  Ubuntu, …, e.g. `artful`). Defaults to a recent version of the
  chosen distribution.

`Mirror=`, `--mirror=`, `-m`

: The mirror to use for downloading the distribution packages. Expects
  a mirror URL as argument.

`LocalMirror=`, `--local-mirror=`

: The mirror will be used as a local, plain and direct mirror instead
  of using it as a prefix for the full set of repositories normally supported
  by distributions. Useful for fully offline builds with a single repository.
  Supported on deb/rpm/arch based distributions. Overrides `--mirror=` but only
  for the local mkosi build, it will not be configured inside the final image,
  `--mirror=` (or the default repository) will be configured inside the final
  image instead.

`RepositoryKeyCheck=`, `--repository-key-check=`

: Controls signature/key checks when using repositories, enabled by default.
  Useful to disable checks when combined with `--local-mirror=` and using only
  a repository from a local filesystem. Not used for DNF-based distros yet.

`Repositories=`, `--repositories=`

: Additional package repositories to use during installation. Expects
  one or more URLs as argument, separated by commas. This option may
  be used multiple times, in which case the list of repositories to
  use is combined. Use "!\*" to remove all repositories from to the list
  or use e.g. "!repo-url" to remove just one specific repository. For Arch
  Linux, additional repositories must be passed in the form `<name>::<url>`
  (e.g. `myrepo::https://myrepo.net`).

`RepositoryDirectories`, `--repository-directory`

: This option can (for now) only be used with RPM-based distributions and Arch
  Linux. It takes a comma separated list of directories containing extra repository
  definitions that will be used when installing packages. The files are passed
  directly to the corresponding package manager and should be written in the format
  expected by the package manager of the image's distro.

`Architecture=`, `--architecture=`

: The architecture to build the image for. Note that this currently
  only works for architectures compatible with the host's
  architecture.

### [Output] Section

`Format=`, `--format=`, `-t`

: The image format type to generate. One of `directory` (for generating OS
  images inside a local directory), `subvolume` (similar, but as a btrfs
  subvolume), `tar` (similar, but a tarball of the image is generated), `cpio`
  (similar, but a cpio archive is generated), `disk` (a block device image
  with a GPT partition table).

`ManifestFormat=`, `--manifest-format=`

: The manifest format type or types to generate. A comma-delimited
  list consisting of `json` (the standard JSON output format that
  describes the packages installed), `changelog` (a human-readable
  text format designed for diffing). Defaults to `json`.

`Output=`, `--output=`, `-o`

: Path for the output image file to generate. Takes a relative or
  absolute path where the generated image will be placed. If neither
  this option nor `OutputDirectory=` is used, the image is
  generated under the name `image`, but its name suffixed with an
  appropriate file suffix (e.g. `image.raw.xz` in case `gpt_ext4` is
  used in combination with `xz` compression). If the `ImageId=` option
  is configured it is used instead of `image` in the default output
  name. If an image version is specified via `ImageVersion=`, it is
  included in the default name, e.g. a specified image version of
  `7.8` might result in an image file name of `image_7.8.raw.xz`.

`OutputDirectory=`, `--output-dir=`, `-O`

: Path to a directory where to place all generated artifacts (i.e. the
  generated image when an output path is not given, `SHA256SUMS` file,
  etc.). If this is not specified and the directory `mkosi.output/`
  exists in the local directory, it is automatically used for this
  purpose. If the setting is not used and `mkosi.output/` does not
  exist, all output artifacts are placed adjacent to the output image
  file. If an output directory is configured, mkosi will create
  `distro~release` subdirectories in it to store the artfifacts per
  distro, release combination that's built.

`WorkspaceDirectory=`, `--workspace-dir=`

: Path to a directory where to store data required temporarily while
  building the image. This directory should have enough space to store
  the full OS image, though in most modes the actually used disk space
  is smaller. If not specified, and `mkosi.workspace/` exists in the
  local directory, it is used for this purpose. Otherwise, a
  subdirectory in the output directory is used.

: The data in this directory is removed automatically after each
  build. It's safe to manually remove the contents of this directory
  should an `mkosi` invocation be aborted abnormally (for example, due
  to reboot/power failure).

`Force=`, `--force`, `-f`

: Replace the output file if it already exists, when building an
  image. By default when building an image and an output artifact
  already exists `mkosi` will refuse operation. Specify this option
  once to delete all build artifacts from a previous run before
  re-building the image. If incremental builds are enabled,
  specifying this option twice will ensure the intermediary
  cache files are removed, too, before the re-build is initiated. If a
  package cache is used (also see the "Files" section below),
  specifying this option thrice will ensure the package cache is
  removed too, before the re-build is initiated. For the `clean`
  operation this option has a slightly different effect: by default
  the verb will only remove build artifacts from a previous run, when
  specified once the incremental cache files are deleted too, and when
  specified twice the package cache is also removed.

  <!--  FIXME: allow `Force=<n>` -->

`Bootable=`, `--bootable`, `-b`

: Generate a bootable image for UEFI systems.

`KernelCommandLine=`, `--kernel-command-line=`

: Use the specified kernel command line when building bootable
  images. By default command line arguments get appended. To remove all
  arguments from the current list pass "!\*". To remove specific arguments
  add a space separated list of "!" prefixed arguments.
  For example adding "!\* console=ttyS0 rw" to a `mkosi.conf` file or the
  command line arguments passes "console=ttyS0 rw" to the kernel in any
  case. Just adding "console=ttyS0 rw" would append these two arguments
  to the kernel command line created by lower priority configuration
  files or previous `KernelCommandLine=` command line arguments.

`SecureBoot=`, `--secure-boot`

: Sign the resulting kernel/initrd image for UEFI SecureBoot.

`SecureBootKey=`, `--secure-boot-key=`

: Path to the PEM file containing the secret key for signing the
  UEFI kernel image, if `SecureBoot=` is used.

`SecureBootCertificate=`, `--secure-boot-certificate=`

: Path to the X.509 file containing the certificate for the signed
  UEFI kernel image, if `SecureBoot=` is used.

`SecureBootCommonName=`, `--secure-boot-common-name=`

: Common name to be used when generating SecureBoot keys via mkosi's `genkey`
  command. Defaults to `mkosi of %u`, where `%u` expands to the username of the
  user invoking mkosi.

`SecureBootValidDays=`, `--secure-boot-valid-days=`

: Number of days that the keys should remain valid when generating SecureBoot
  keys via mkosi's `genkey` command. Defaults to two years (730 days).

[//]: # (Please add external tools to the list here.)

`SignExpectedPCR=`, `--sign-expected-pcr`

: Measure the components of the unified kernel image (UKI) using
  `systemd-measure` and embed the PCR signature into the unified kernel
  image. This option takes a boolean value or the special value `auto`,
  which is the default, which is equal to a true value if the
  [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/) module is importable and
  the `systemd-measure` binary is in `PATH`.

`CompressOutput=`, `--compress-output=`

: Configure compression for the resulting image or archive. The
  argument can be either a boolean or a compression algorithm (`xz`,
  `zstd`). `xz` compression is used by default. Note that when applied
  to block device image types this means the image cannot be started
  directly but needs to be decompressed first. This also means that
  the `shell`, `boot`, `qemu` verbs are not available when this option
  is used. Implied for `tar` and `cpio`.

`QCow2=`, `--qcow2`

: Encode the resulting image as QEMU QCOW2 image. This only applies when
  generating disk images. QCOW2 images can be read natively by `qemu`, but
  not by the Linux kernel. This means the `shell` and `boot` verbs are not
  available when this option is used, however `qemu` will work.

`Hostname=`, `--hostname=`

: Set the image's hostname to the specified name.

`ImageVersion=`, `--image-version=`

: Configure the image version. This accepts any string, but it is
  recommended to specify a series of dot separated components. The
  version may also be configured in a file `mkosi.version` in which
  case it may be conveniently managed via the `bump` verb or the
  `--auto-bump` switch. When specified the image version is included
  in the default output file name, i.e. instead of `image.raw` the
  default will be `image_0.1.raw` for version `0.1` of the image, and
  similar. The version is also passed via the `$IMAGE_VERSION` to any
  build scripts invoked (which may be useful to patch it into
  `/etc/os-release` or similar, in particular the `IMAGE_VERSION=`
  field of it).

`ImageId=`, `--image-id=`

: Configure the image identifier. This accepts a freeform string that
  shall be used to identify the image with. If set the default output
  file will be named after it (possibly suffixed with the version). If
  this option is used the root, `/usr/` and Verity partitions in the
  image will have their labels set to this (possibly suffixed by the
  image version). The identifier is also passed via the `$IMAGE_ID` to
  any build scripts invoked (which may be useful to patch it into
  `/etc/os-release` or similar, in particular the `IMAGE_ID=` field of
  it).

`CacheInitrd=`, `--cache-initrd`

: If specified, and incremental mode is used, mkosi will build the initrd
  in the cache image and reuse it in the final image. Note that this means
  that any changes that are only applied to the final image and not the
  cached image won't be included in the initrd.

`SplitArtifacts=`, `--split-artifacts`

: If specified and building a disk image, pass `--split=yes` to systemd-repart
  to have it write out split partition files for each configured partition.
  Read the [man](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-repart.html#--split=BOOL)
  page for more information. This is useful in A/B update scenarios where
  an existing disk image shall be augmented with a new version of a
  root or `/usr` partition along with its Verity partition and unified
  kernel.

`RepartDirectory=`, `--repart-directory`

: Path to a directory containing systemd-repart partition definition files that
  are used when mkosi invokes systemd-repart when building a disk image. If not
  specified and `mkosi.repart/` exists in the local directory, it will be used
  instead. Note that mkosi invokes repart with `--root=` set to the root of the
  image root, so any `CopyFiles=` source paths in partition definition files will
  be relative to the image root directory.

`NoChown=`, `--no-chown`

: By default, if `mkosi` is run inside a `sudo` environment all
  generated artifacts have their UNIX user/group ownership changed to
  the user which invoked `sudo`. With this option this may be turned
  off and all generated files are owned by `root`.

`TarStripSELinuxContext=`, `--tar-strip-selinux-context`

: If running on a SELinux-enabled system (Fedora Linux, CentOS, Rocky Linux,
  Alma Linux), files
  inside the container are tagged with SELinux context extended
  attributes (`xattrs`), which may interfere with host SELinux rules
  in building or further container import stages.  This option strips
  SELinux context attributes from the resulting tar archive.

`MachineID=`, `--machine-id`

: Set the machine's ID to the specified value. If unused, a random ID will
be used while building the image and the final image will be shipped without
a machine ID.

### [Content] Section

`BasePackages=`, `--base-packages`

: Takes a boolean or the special value `conditional`. If true,
  automatically install packages to ensure basic functionality, as
  appropriate for the given image type. For example, `systemd` is
  always included, `systemd-udev` and `dracut` if the image is
  bootable, and so on.

: If false, only packages specified with `Packages=` will be
  installed.

: If `conditional`, the list of packages to install will be extended
  with boolean dependencies
  (c.f. https://rpm.org/user_doc/boolean_dependencies.html), to
  install specific packages when *other* packages are in the list. For
  example, `systemd-udev` may be automatically included if the image
  is bootable and `systemd` is installed. With this, various "base"
  packages still need to be specified if they should be included, but
  the corresponding "extension" packages will be added automatically
  when appropriate. This feature depends on support in the package
  manager, so it is not implemented for all distributions.

`Packages=`, `--package=`, `-p`

: Install the specified distribution packages (i.e. RPM, DEB, …) in the
  image. Takes a comma separated list of package specifications. This option
  may be used multiple times in which case the specified package lists are
  combined. Packages specified this way will be installed both in the
  development and the final image. Use `BuildPackages=` to specify packages
  that shall only be used for the image generated in the build image, but that
  shall not appear in the final image.

: The types and syntax of "package specifications" that are allowed depend on
  the package installer (e.g. `dnf` or `yum` for `rpm`-based distros or `apt`
  for `deb`-based distros), but may include package names, package names with
  version and/or architecture, package name globs, paths to packages in the
  file system, package groups, and virtual provides, including file paths.

: To remove a package e.g. added by a `mkosi.conf` configuration
  file prepend the package name with `!`. For example -p "!apache2"
  would remove the apache2 package. To replace the apache2 package by
  the httpd package just add -p "!apache2,httpd" to the command line
  arguments. To remove all packages use "!\*".

: Example: when using an distro that uses `dnf`,
  `Packages=meson libfdisk-devel.i686 git-* prebuilt/rpms/systemd-249-rc1.local.rpm /usr/bin/ld @development-tools python3dist(mypy)`
  would install
  the `meson` package (in the latest version),
  the 32-bit version of the `libfdisk-devel` package,
  all available packages that start with the `git-` prefix,
  a `systemd` rpm from the local file system,
  one of the packages that provides `/usr/bin/ld`,
  the packages in the "Development Tools" group,
  and the package that contains the `mypy` python module.

`WithDocs=`, `--with-docs`

: Include documentation in the image built. By default if the
  underlying distribution package manager supports it documentation is
  not included in the image built. The `$WITH_DOCS` environment
  variable passed to the `mkosi.build` script indicates whether this
  option was used or not.

`WithTests=`, `--without-tests`, `-T`

: If set to false (or when the command-line option is used), the
  `$WITH_TESTS` environment variable is set to `0` when the
  `mkosi.build` script is invoked. This is supposed to be used by the
  build script to bypass any unit or integration tests that are
  normally run during the source build process. Note that this option
  has no effect unless the `mkosi.build` build script honors it.

`Cache=`, `--cache=`

: Takes a path to a directory to use as package cache for the
  distribution package manager used. If this option is not used, but a
  `mkosi.cache/` directory is found in the local directory it is
  automatically used for this purpose. The directory configured this
  way is mounted into both the development and the final image while
  the package manager is running.

`SkeletonTree=`, `--skeleton-tree=`

: Takes a path to a directory to copy into the OS tree before invoking
  the package manager. Use this to insert files and directories into
  the OS tree before the package manager installs any packages. If
  this option is not used, but the `mkosi.skeleton/` directory is
  found in the local directory it is automatically used for this
  purpose (also see the "Files" section below).

: Instead of a directory, a tar file may be provided. In this case
  it is unpacked into the OS tree before the package manager is
  invoked. This mode of operation allows setting permissions and file
  ownership explicitly, in particular for projects stored in a version
  control system such as `git` which retain full file ownership and
  access mode metadata for committed files. If the tar file
  `mkosi.skeleton.tar` is found in the local directory it will be
  automatically used for this purpose.

`ExtraTree=`, `--extra-tree=`

: Takes a path to a directory to copy on top of the OS tree the
  package manager generated. Use this to override any default
  configuration files shipped with the distribution. If this option is
  not used, but the `mkosi.extra/` directory is found in the local
  directory it is automatically used for this purpose (also see the
  "Files" section below).

: As with the skeleton tree logic above, instead of a directory, a tar
  file may be provided too. `mkosi.skeleton.tar` will be automatically
  used if found in the local directory.

`CleanPackageMetadata=`, `--clean-package-metadata=`

: Enable/disable removal of package manager databases, caches, and
  logs at the end of installation. Can be specified as true, false, or
  "`auto`" (the default). With "`auto`", files will be removed if the
  respective package manager executable is *not* present at the end of
  the installation.

`RemoveFiles=`, `--remove-files=`

: Takes a comma-separated list of globs. Files in the image matching
  the globs will be purged at the end.

`RemovePackages=`, `--remove-package=`

: Takes a comma-separated list of package specifications for removal, in the
  same format as `Packages=`. The removal will be performed as one of the last
  steps. This step is skipped if `CleanPackageMetadata=no` is used.

: This option is currently only implemented for distributions using `dnf`.

`Environment=`, `--environment=`

: Adds variables to the environment that the
  build/prepare/postinstall/finalize scripts are executed with. Takes
  a space-separated list of variable assignments or just variable
  names. In the latter case, the values of those variables will be
  passed through from the environment in which `mkosi` was invoked.
  This option may be specified more than once, in which case all
  listed variables will be set. If the same variable is set twice, the
  later setting overrides the earlier one.

`BuildSources=`, `--build-sources=`

: Takes a path to a source tree to copy into the development image, if
  the build script is used. This only applies if a build script is
  used, and defaults to the local directory. Use `SourceFileTransfer=`
  to configure how the files are transferred from the host to the
  container image.

`BuildDirectory=`, `--build-dir=`

: Takes a path of a directory to use as build directory for build
  systems that support out-of-tree builds (such as Meson). The
  directory used this way is shared between repeated builds, and
  allows the build system to reuse artifacts (such as object files,
  executable, …) generated on previous invocations. This directory is
  mounted into the development image when the build script is
  invoked. The build script can find the path to this directory in the
  `$BUILDDIR` environment variable. If this option is not specified,
  but a directory `mkosi.builddir/` exists in the local directory it
  is automatically used for this purpose (also see the "Files" section
  below).

`IncludeDirectory=`, `--include-directory=`

: Takes a path of a directory to use as the include directory. This
  directory is mounted at `/usr/include` when building the build image
  and running the build script. This means all include files installed
  to `/usr/include` will be stored in this directory. This is useful
  to make include files available on the host system for use by
  language servers to provide code completion. If this option is not
  specified, but a directory `mkosi.includedir/` exists in the local
  directory, it is automatically used for this purpose (also see the
  "Files" section below).

`InstallDirectory=`, `--install-directory=`

: Takes a path of a directory to use as the install directory. The
  directory used this way is shared between builds and allows the
  build system to not have to reinstall files that were already
  installed by a previous build and didn't change. The build script
  can find the path to this directory in the `$DESTDIR` environment
  variable. If this option is not specified, but a directory
  `mkosi.installdir` exists in the local directory, it is automatically
  used for this purpose (also see the "Files" section below).

`BuildPackages=`, `--build-package=`

: Similar to `Packages=`, but configures packages to install only in
  the first phase of the build, into the development image. This
  option should be used to list packages containing header files,
  compilers, build systems, linkers and other build tools the
  `mkosi.build` script requires to operate. Note that packages listed
  here are only included in the image created during the first phase
  of the build, and are absent in the final image. Use `Packages=` to
  list packages that shall be included in both.

: Packages are appended to the list. Packages prefixed with "!" are
  removed from the list. "!\*" removes all packages from the list.

`Password=`, `--password=`

: Set the password of the `root` user. By default the `root` account
  is locked. If this option is not used, but a file `mkosi.rootpw`
  exists in the local directory, the root password is automatically
  read from it.

`PasswordIsHashed=`, `--password-is-hashed`

: Indicate that the password supplied for the `root` user has already been
  hashed, so that the string supplied with `Password=` or `mkosi.rootpw` will
  be written to `/etc/shadow` literally.

`Autologin=`, `--autologin`

: Enable autologin for the `root` user on `/dev/pts/0` (nspawn),
  `/dev/tty1` (QEMU) and `/dev/ttyS0` (QEMU with `QemuHeadless=yes`)
  by patching `/etc/pam.d/login`.

`SkipFinalPhase=`, `--skip-final-phase=`

: Causes the (second) final image build stage to be skipped. This is
  useful in combination with a build script, for when you care about
  the artifacts that were created locally in `$BUILDDIR`, but
  ultimately plan to discard the final image.

`BuildScript=`, `--build-script=`

: Takes a path to an executable that is used as build script for this
  image. If this option is used the build process will be two-phased
  instead of single-phased. The specified script is copied onto the
  development image and executed inside an `systemd-nspawn` container
  environment. If this option is not used, but the `mkosi.build` file
  found in the local directory it is automatically used for this
  purpose (also see the "Files" section below). Specify an empty value
  to disable automatic detection.

`PrepareScript=`, `--prepare-script=`

: Takes a path to an executable that is invoked inside the image right
  after installing the software packages. It is the last step before
  the image is cached (if incremental mode is enabled).  This script
  is invoked inside a `systemd-nspawn` container environment, and thus
  does not have access to host resources.  If this option is not used,
  but an executable script `mkosi.prepare` is found in the local
  directory, it is automatically used for this purpose. Specify an
  empty value to disable automatic detection.

`PostInstallationScript=`, `--postinst-script=`

: Takes a path to an executable that is invoked inside the final image
  right after copying in the build artifacts generated in the first
  phase of the build. This script is invoked inside a `systemd-nspawn`
  container environment, and thus does not have access to host
  resources. If this option is not used, but an executable
  `mkosi.postinst` is found in the local directory, it is
  automatically used for this purpose. Specify an empty value to
  disable automatic detection.

`FinalizeScript=`, `--finalize-script=`

: Takes a path to an executable that is invoked outside the final
  image right after copying in the build artifacts generated in the
  first phase of the build, and after having executed the
  `mkosi.postinst` script (see `PostInstallationScript=`). This script
  is invoked directly in the host environment, and hence has full
  access to the host's resources. If this option is not used, but an
  executable `mkosi.finalize` is found in the local directory, it is
  automatically used for this purpose. Specify an empty value to
  disable automatic detection.

`SourceFileTransfer=`, `--source-file-transfer=`

: Configures how the source file tree (as configured with
  `BuildSources=`) is transferred into the container image during the
  first phase of the build. Takes one of `copy-all` (to copy all files
  from the source tree), `copy-git-cached` (to copy only those files
  `git ls-files --cached` lists), `copy-git-others` (to copy only
  those files `git ls-files --others` lists), `mount` to bind mount
  the source tree directly. Defaults to `copy-git-cached` if a `git`
  source tree is detected, otherwise `copy-all`. When you specify
  `copy-git-more`, it is the same as `copy-git-cached`, except it also
  includes the `.git/` directory.

`SourceFileTransferFinal=`, `--source-file-transfer-final=`

: Same as `SourceFileTransfer=`, but for the final image instead of
  the build image. Takes the same values as `SourceFileFransfer=`
  except `mount`. By default, sources are not copied into the final
  image.

`SourceResolveSymlinks=`, `--source-resolve-symlinks`

: If given, any symbolic links in the source file tree are resolved and the
  file contents are copied to the build image. If not given, they are left as
  symbolic links. This only applies if `SourceFileTransfer=` is `copy-all`.
  Defaults to leaving them as symbolic links.

`SourceResolveSymlinksFinal=`, `--source-resolve-symlinks-final`

: Same as `SourceResolveSymlinks=`, but for the final image instead of
  the build image.

`WithNetwork=`, `--with-network`

: When true, enables network connectivity while the build script
  `mkosi.build` is invoked. By default, the build script runs with
  networking turned off. The `$WITH_NETWORK` environment variable is
  passed to the `mkosi.build` build script indicating whether the
  build is done with or without network. If specified as `never`, the
  package manager is instructed not to contact the network for
  updating package data. This provides a minimal level of
  reproducibility, as long as the package data cache is already fully
  populated.

`Settings=`, `--settings=`

: Specifies a `.nspawn` settings file for `systemd-nspawn` to use in
  the `boot` and `shell` verbs, and to place next to the generated
  image file. This is useful to configure the `systemd-nspawn`
  environment when the image is run. If this setting is not used but
  an `mkosi.nspawn` file found in the local directory it is
  automatically used for this purpose.

<!-- FIXME: shouldn't this be in [Host] ? -->

### [Partitions] Section

`BaseImage=`, `--base-image=`

: Use the specified directory or file system image as the base image,
  and create the output image that consists only of changes from this
  base. The base image is attached as the lower file system in an
  overlayfs structure, and the output filesystem becomes the upper
  layer, initially empty. Thus files that are not modified compared to
  the base image are not present in the output image.

: This option may be used to create systemd "system extensions" or
  portable services. See
  https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES/#extension-images for more
  information.

### [Validation] Section

`Checksum=`, `--checksum`

: Generate a `SHA256SUMS` file of all generated artifacts after the
  build is complete.

`Sign=`, `--sign`

: Sign the generated `SHA256SUMS` using `gpg` after completion.

`Key=`, `--key=`

: Select the `gpg` key to use for signing `SHA256SUMS`. This key must
  be already present in the `gpg` keyring.

`BMap=`, `--bmap`

: Generate a `bmap` file for usage with `bmaptool` from the generated
  image file.

### [Host] Section

`ExtraSearchPaths=`, `--extra-search-paths=`

: List of colon-separated paths to look for tools in, before using the
  regular `$PATH` search path.

`QemuHeadless=`, `--qemu-headless=`

: When used with the `build` verb, this option adds `console=ttyS0` to
  the image's kernel command line and sets the terminal type of the
  serial console in the image to the terminal type of the host (more
  specifically, the value of the `$TERM` environment variable passed
  to mkosi). This makes sure that all terminal features such as colors
  and shortcuts still work as expected when connecting to the qemu VM
  over the serial console (for example via `-nographic`).

: When used with the `qemu` verb, this option adds the `-nographic`
  option to `qemu`'s command line so qemu starts a headless vm and
  connects to its serial console from the current terminal instead of
  launching the VM in a separate window.

`QemuSmp=`, `--qemu-smp=`

: When used with the `qemu` verb, this options sets `qemu`'s `-smp`
  argument which controls the number of guest's CPUs. Defaults to `2`.

`QemuMem=`, `--qemu-mem=`

: When used with the `qemu` verb, this options sets `qemu`'s `-m`
  argument which controls the amount of guest's RAM. Defaults to `1G`.

`QemuKvm=`, `--qemu-kvm=`

: When used with the `qemu` verb, this option specifies whether QEMU
  should use KVM acceleration. Defaults to yes if the host machine
  supports KVM acceleration, no otherwise.

`QemuArgs=`

: Space-delimited list of additional arguments to pass when invoking
  qemu.

`NspawnKeepUnit=`, `--nspawn-keep-unit`

: When used, this option instructs underlying calls of systemd-nspawn to
  use the current unit scope, instead of creating a dedicated transcient
  scope unit for the containers. This option should be used when mkosi is
  run by a service unit.

`Netdev=`, `--netdev`

: When used with the boot or qemu verbs, this option creates a virtual
  ethernet link between the host and the container/VM. The host
  interface is automatically picked up by systemd-networkd as documented
  in systemd-nspawn's man page:
  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html#-n

`Ephemeral=`, `--ephemeral`

: When used with the `shell`, `boot`, or `qemu` verbs, this option
  runs the specified verb on a temporary snapshot of the output image
  that is removed immediately when the container terminates. Taking
  the temporary snapshot is more efficient on file systems that
  support subvolume snapshots or 'reflinks' natively ("btrfs" or new
  "xfs") than on more traditional file systems that do not ("ext4").

`Ssh=`, `--ssh`

: If specified, installs and enables `sshd` in the final image and generates
  a SSH keypair and adds the public key to root's `authorized_keys` in the final
  image. The private key is stored in mkosi's output directory. When building
  with this  option and running the image using `mkosi boot` or `mkosi qemu`,
  the `mkosi ssh` command can be used to connect to the container/VM via SSH.

`SshKey=`, `--ssh-key=`

: If specified, use the given private key when connecting to the guest machine
  via `mkosi ssh`. This requires the public key counterpart to be present in
  the same location, suffixed with `.pub` (as done by `ssh-keygen`). If this
  option is not present, `mkosi` generates a new key pair automatically.

`SshAgent=`, `--ssh-agent=`

: If specified as a path, use the given socket to connect to the ssh agent when
  building an image and when connecting via `mkosi ssh` instead of hard-coding
  a key. If specified as `true`, `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` will be parsed instead (hint:
  use `sudo` with `-E`). The keys listed by `ssh-add -L` will be installed as
  authorized keys in the built image. The `ssh` invocation done by `mkosi ssh`
  will inherit `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` for authentication purposes.

`SshPort=`, `--ssh-port=`

: In the image, sshd will be configured to listen on this port. `mkosi ssh` will
  connect to this port.

`SshTimeout=`, `--ssh-timeout=`

: When used with the `ssh` verb, `mkosi` will attempt to retry the SSH connection
  up to given timeout (in seconds) in case it fails. This option is useful mainly
  in scripted environments where the `qemu` and `ssh` verbs are used in a quick
  succession and the virtual device might not get enough time to configure itself.

`Credentials=`, `--credential`

: Set credentials to be passed to systemd-nspawn or qemu respectively when
  `mkosi shell/boot` or `mkosi qemu` are used. This option takes a space separated
  list of key=value assignments.

### Commandline-only Options

Those settings cannot be configured in the configuration files.

`--directory=`, `-C`

: Takes a path to a directory. `mkosi` switches to this directory
  before doing anything. Note that the various `mkosi.*` files are
  searched for only after changing to this directory, hence using this
  option is an effective way to build a project located in a specific
  directory.

`--config=`

: Loads additional settings from the specified settings file. Most
  command line options may also be configured in a settings file. See
  the table below to see which command line options match which
  settings file option. If this option is not used, but a file
  `mkosi.conf` is found in the local directory it is automatically
  used for this purpose. If a setting is configured both on the
  command line and in the settings file, the command line generally
  wins, except for options taking lists in which case both lists are
  combined.

`--all`, `-a`

: Iterate through all files `mkosi.*` in the `mkosi.files/`
  subdirectory, and build each as if `--config=mkosi.files/mkosi.…`
  was invoked. This is a quick way to build a large number of images
  in one go. Any additional specified command line arguments override
  the relevant options in all files processed this way.

`--all-directory=`

: If specified, overrides the directory the `--all` logic described
  above looks for settings files in. If unspecified, defaults to
  `mkosi.files/` in the current working directory.

`--incremental`, `-i`

: Enable incremental build mode. This only applies if the two-phase
  `mkosi.build` build script logic is used. In this mode, a copy of
  the OS image is created immediately after all OS packages are
  unpacked but before the `mkosi.build` script is invoked in the
  development container. Similarly, a copy of the final image is
  created immediately before the build artifacts from the
  `mkosi.build` script are copied in. On subsequent invocations of
  `mkosi` with the `-i` switch these cached images may be used to skip
  the OS package unpacking, thus drastically speeding up repetitive
  build times. Note that when this is used and a pair of cached
  incremental images exists they are not automatically regenerated,
  even if options such as `Packages=` are modified. In order to force
  rebuilding of these cached images, combine `-i` with `-ff` to ensure
  cached images are first removed and then re-created.

`--debug=`

: Enable additional debugging output. Takes a comma-separated list of
  arguments specifying the area of interest. Pass any invalid value
  (e.g. empty) to list currently accepted values.

`--version`

: Show package version.

`--help`, `-h`

: Show brief usage information.

`--auto-bump`, `-B`

: If specified, after each successful build the the version is bumped
  in a fashion equivalent to the `bump` verb, in preparation for the
  next build. This is useful for simple, linear version management:
  each build in a series will have a version number one higher then
  the previous one.

## Supported distributions

Images may be created containing installations of the
following operating systems:

* *Fedora Linux*

* *Debian*

* *Ubuntu*

* *Arch Linux*

* *openSUSE*

* *Mageia*

* *CentOS*

* *OpenMandriva*

* *Rocky Linux*

* *Alma Linux*

* *Gentoo*

In theory, any distribution may be used on the host for building
images containing any other distribution, as long as the necessary
tools are available. Specifically, any distribution that packages
`debootstrap` and `apt` may be used to build *Debian* or *Ubuntu* images. Any
distribution that packages `dnf` may be used to build *CentOS*, *Alma Linux*,
*Rocky Linux*, *Fedora Linux*, *Mageia* or *OpenMandriva* images. Any distro
that packages `pacman` may be used to build *Arch Linux* images. Any distribution
that packages `zypper` may be used to build *openSUSE* images. Any distribution
that packages `emerge` may be used to build *Gentoo* images.

Currently, *Fedora Linux* packages all relevant tools as of Fedora 28.

## Compatibility

Legacy concepts are avoided: generated images use *GPT* disk labels
(and no *MBR* labels), and only systemd-based images may be generated.

All generated *GPT* disk images may be booted in a local
container directly with:

```bash
systemd-nspawn -bi image.raw
```

Additionally, bootable *GPT* disk images (as created with the
`--bootable` flag) work when booted directly by *EFI* systems,
for example in *KVM* via:

```bash
qemu-kvm -m 512 -smp 2 -bios /usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_CODE.fd -drive format=raw,file=image.raw
```

*EFI* bootable *GPT* images are larger than plain *GPT* images, as
they additionally carry an *EFI* system partition containing a
boot loader, as well as a kernel, kernel modules, udev and
more.

All directory or btrfs subvolume images may be booted directly
with:

```bash
systemd-nspawn -bD image
```

# Files

To make it easy to build images for development versions of your
projects, mkosi can read configuration data from the local directory,
under the assumption that it is invoked from a *source*
tree. Specifically, the following files are used if they exist in the
local directory:

* The **`mkosi.conf`** file provides the default configuration for
  the image building process. For example, it may specify the
  distribution to use (`fedora`, `ubuntu`, `debian`, `arch`,
  `opensuse`, `mageia`, `openmandriva`, `gentoo`) for the image, or additional
  distribution packages to install. Note that all options encoded in
  this configuration file may also be set on the command line, and
  this file is hence little more than a way to make sure invoking
  `mkosi` without further parameters in your *source* tree is enough
  to get the right image of your choice set up.

  Additionally, if a *`mkosi.conf.d/`* directory exists, each file
  in it is loaded in the same manner adding/overriding the values
  specified in `mkosi.conf`. If `mkosi.conf.d/` contains a
  directory named after the distribution being built, each file in
  that directory is also processed.

  The file format is inspired by Windows `.ini` files and supports
  multi-line assignments: any line with initial whitespace is
  considered a continuation line of the line before. Command-line
  arguments, as shown in the help description, have to be included in
  a configuration block (e.g.  "`[Content]`") corresponding to the
  argument group (e.g. "`Content`"), and the argument gets converted
  as follows: "`--with-network`" becomes "`WithNetwork=yes`". For
  further details see the table above.

* The **`mkosi.skeleton/`** directory or **`mkosi.skeleton.tar`**
  archive may be used to insert files into the image. The files are
  copied *before* the distribution packages are installed into the
  image.  This allows creation of files that need to be provided
  early, for example to configure the package manager or set systemd
  presets.

  When using the directory, file ownership is not preserved: all files
  copied will be owned by root. To preserve ownership, use a tar
  archive.

* The **`mkosi.extra/`** directory or **`mkosi.extra.tar`** archive
  may be used to insert additional files into the image, on top of
  what the distribution includes in its packages. They are similar to
  `mkosi.skeleton/` and `mkosi.skeleton.tar`, but the files are copied
  into the directory tree of the image *after* the OS was installed.

  When using the directory, file ownership is not preserved: all files
  copied will be owned by root. To preserve ownership, use a tar
  archive.

* **`mkosi.build`** may be an executable script. If it exists, the
  image will be built twice: the first iteration will be the
  *development* image, the second iteration will be the *final*
  image. The *development* image is used to build the project in the
  current working directory (the *source* tree). For that the whole
  directory is copied into the image, along with the `mkosi.build`
  script. The script is then invoked inside the image (via
  `systemd-nspawn`), with `$SRCDIR` pointing to the *source*
  tree. `$DESTDIR` points to a directory where the script should place
  any files generated it would like to end up in the *final*
  image. Note that `make`/`automake`/`meson` based build systems
  generally honor `$DESTDIR`, thus making it very natural to build
  *source* trees from the build script. After the *development* image
  was built and the build script ran inside of it, it is removed
  again. After that the *final* image is built, without any *source*
  tree or build script copied in. However, this time the contents of
  `$DESTDIR` are added into the image.

  When the source tree is copied into the *build* image, all files are
  copied, except for `mkosi.builddir/`, `mkosi.cache/` and
  `mkosi.output/`. That said, `.gitignore` is respected if the source
  tree is a `git` checkout. If multiple different images shall be
  built from the same source tree it is essential to exclude their
  output files from this copy operation, as otherwise a version of an
  image built earlier might be included in a later build, which is
  usually not intended. An alternative to excluding these built images
  via `.gitignore` entries is to use the `mkosi.output/` directory,
  which is an easy way to exclude all build artifacts.

  The `$MKOSI_CONFIG` environment variable will be set inside of this
  script so that you know which `mkosi.conf` (if any) was passed
  in.

* The **`mkosi.prepare`** script is invoked directly after the
  software packages are installed, from within the image context, if
  it exists. It is once called for the *development* image (if this is
  enabled, see above) with the "build" command line parameter, right
  before copying the extra tree. It is called a second time for the
  *final* image with the "final" command line parameter. This script
  has network access and may be used to install packages from other
  sources than the distro's package manager (e.g. `pip`, `npm`, ...),
  after all software packages are installed but before the image is
  cached (if incremental mode is enabled). This script is executed
  within `$SRCDIR`. In contrast to a general purpose installation, it
  is safe to install packages to the system (`pip install`, `npm
  install -g`) instead of in `$SRCDIR` itself because the build image
  is only used for a single project and can easily be thrown away and
  rebuilt so there's no risk of conflicting dependencies and no risk
  of polluting the host system.

* The **`mkosi.postinst`** script is invoked as the penultimate step
  of preparing an image, from within the image context, if it exists.
  It is called first for the *development* image (if this is enabled,
  see above) with the "build" command line parameter, right before
  invoking the build script. It is called a second time for the
  *final* image with the "final" command line parameter, right before
  the image is considered complete. This script may be used to alter
  the images without any restrictions, after all software packages and
  built sources have been installed. Note that this script is executed
  directly in the image context with the final root directory in
  place, without any `$SRCDIR`/`$DESTDIR` setup.

* The **`mkosi.finalize`** script, if it exists, is invoked as last
  step of preparing an image, from the host system.  It is once called
  for the *development* image (if this is enabled, see above) with the
  "build" command line parameter, as the last step before invoking the
  build script, after the `mkosi.postinst` script is invoked. It is
  called the second time with the "final" command line parameter as
  the last step before the image is considered complete. The
  environment variable `$BUILDROOT` points to the root directory of
  the installation image. Additional verbs may be added in the future,
  the script should be prepared for that. This script may be used to
  alter the images without any restrictions, after all software
  packages and built sources have been installed. This script is more
  flexible than `mkosi.postinst` in two regards: it has access to the
  host file system so it's easier to copy in additional files or to
  modify the image based on external configuration, and the script is
  run in the host, so it can be used even without emulation even if
  the image has a foreign architecture.

* The **`mkosi.nspawn`** nspawn settings file will be copied into the
  same place as the output image file, if it exists. This is useful since nspawn
  looks for settings files next to image files it boots, for
  additional container runtime settings.

* The **`mkosi.cache/`** directory, if it exists, is automatically
  used as package download cache, in order to speed repeated runs of
  the tool.

* The **`mkosi.builddir/`** directory, if it exists, is automatically
  used as out-of-tree build directory, if the build commands in the
  `mkosi.build` script support it. Specifically, this directory will
  be mounted into the build container, and the `$BUILDDIR` environment
  variable will be set to it when the build script is invoked. The
  build script may then use this directory as build directory, for
  automake-style or ninja-style out-of-tree builds. This speeds up
  builds considerably, in particular when `mkosi` is used in
  incremental mode (`-i`): not only the disk images, but also the
  build tree is reused between subsequent invocations. Note that if
  this directory does not exist the `$BUILDDIR` environment variable
  is not set, and it is up to build script to decide whether to do in
  in-tree or an out-of-tree build, and which build directory to use.

* The **`mkosi.includedir/`** directory, if it exists, is
  automatically used as an out-of-tree include directory for header
  files.  Specifically, it will be mounted in the build container at
  `/usr/include/` when building the build image and when running the
  build script. After building the (cached) build image, this
  directory will contain all the files installed to
  `/usr/include`. Language servers or other tools can use these files
  to provide a better editing experience for developers working on a
  project.

* The **`mkosi.installdir/`** directory, if it exists, is
  automatically used as the install directory. Specifically, this
  directory will be mounted into the container at `/root/dest` when
  running the build script. After running the build script, the
  contents of this directory are installed into the final image. This
  is useful to cache the install step of the build. If used,
  subsequent builds will only have to reinstall files that have
  changed since the previous build.

* The **`mkosi.rootpw`** file can be used to provide the password or
  hashed password (if `--password-is-hashed` is set) for the root user
  of the image.  The password may optionally be followed by a newline
  character which is implicitly removed. The file must have an access
  mode of 0600 or less. If this file does not exist, the
  distribution's default root password is set (which usually means
  access to the root user is blocked).

* The **`mkosi.passphrase`** file provides the passphrase to use when
  LUKS encryption is selected. It should contain the passphrase
  literally, and not end in a newline character (i.e. in the same
  format as cryptsetup and `/etc/crypttab` expect the passphrase
  files). The file must have an access mode of 0600 or less. If this
  file does not exist and encryption is requested, the user is queried
  instead.

* The **`mkosi.secure-boot.crt`** and **`mkosi.secure-boot.key`**
  files contain an X.509 certificate and PEM private key to use when
  UEFI SecureBoot support is enabled. All EFI binaries included in the
  image's ESP are signed with this key, as a late step in the build
  process.

* The **`mkosi.output/`** directory will be used for all build
  artifacts, if the image output path is not configured (i.e. no
  `--output=` setting specified), or configured to a filename (i.e. a
  path containing no `/` character). This includes the image itself,
  the root hash file in case Verity is used, the checksum and its
  signature if that's enabled, and the nspawn settings file if there
  is any. Note that this directory is not used if the image output
  path contains at least one slash, and has no effect in that case.
  This setting is particularly useful if multiple different images
  shall be built from the same working directory, as otherwise the
  build result of a preceding run might be copied into a build image
  as part of the source tree (see above).

* The **`mkosi.reposdir/`** directory, if it exists, is automatically
  used as the repository directory for extra repository files. See
  the `RepositoryDirectory` option for more information.

All these files are optional.

Note that the location of all these files may also be configured
during invocation via command line switches, and as settings in
`mkosi.conf`, in case the default settings are not acceptable for a
project.

# BUILD PHASES

If no build script `mkosi.build` (see above) is used the build
consists of a single phase only: the final image is generated as the
combination of `mkosi.skeleton/` (see above), the unpacked
distribution packages and `mkosi.extra/`.

If a build script `mkosi.build` is used the build consists of two
phases: in the the first `development` phase an image that includes
necessary build tools (i.e. the combination of `Packages=` and
`BuildPackages=` is installed) is generated (i.e. the combination of
`mkosi.skeleton/` and unpacked distribution packages). Into this image
the source tree is copied and `mkosi.build` executed. The artifacts
the `mkosi.build` generates are saved. Then, the second `final` phase
starts: an image that excludes the build tools (i.e. only `Packages=`
is installed, `BuildPackages=` is not) is generated. This time the
build artifacts saved from the first phase are copied in, and
`mkosi.extra` copied on top, thus generating the final image.

The two-phased approach ensures that source tree is executed in a
clean and comprehensive environment, while at the same the final image
remains minimal and contains only those packages necessary at runtime,
but avoiding those necessary at build-time.

Note that only the package cache `mkosi.cache/` is shared between the
two phases. The distribution package manager is executed exactly once
in each phase, always starting from a directory tree that is populated
with `mkosi.skeleton` but nothing else.

# CACHING

`mkosi` supports three different caches for speeding up repetitive
re-building of images. Specifically:

1. The package cache of the distribution package manager may be cached
   between builds. This is configured with the `--cache=` option or
   the `mkosi.cache/` directory. This form of caching relies on the
   distribution's package manager, and caches distribution packages
   (RPM, DEB, …) after they are downloaded, but before they are
   unpacked.

2. If an `mkosi.build` script is used, by enabling incremental build
   mode with `--incremental`, a cached copy of the development and
   final images can be made immediately before the build sources are
   copied in (for the development image) or the artifacts generated by
   `mkosi.build` are copied in (in case of the final image). This form
   of caching allows bypassing the time-consuming package unpacking
   step of the distribution package managers, but is only effective if
   the list of packages to use remains stable, but the build sources
   and its scripts change regularly. Note that this cache requires
   manual flushing: whenever the package list is modified the cached
   images need to be explicitly removed before the next re-build,
   using the `-f` switch.

3. Finally, between multiple builds the build artifact directory may
   be shared, using the `mkosi.builddir/` directory. This directory
   allows build systems such as Meson to reuse already compiled
   sources from a previous built, thus speeding up the build process
   of the `mkosi.build` build script.

The package cache (i.e. the first item above) is unconditionally
useful. The latter two caches only apply to uses of `mkosi` with a
source tree and build script. When all three are enabled together
turn-around times for complete image builds are minimal, as only
changed source files need to be recompiled: an OS image rebuilt will
be almost as quick to build the source tree only.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The build script `mkosi.build` receives the following environment
variables:

* `$SRCDIR` contains the path to the sources to build.

* `$DESTDIR` is a directory into which any artifacts generated by the
  build script shall be placed.

* `$BUILDDIR` is only defined if `mkosi.builddir` and points to the
  build directory to use. This is useful for all build systems that
  support out-of-tree builds to reuse already built artifacts from
  previous runs.

* `$WITH_DOCS` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether a build
  without or with installed documentation was requested
  (`WithDocs=yes`). The build script should suppress installation of
  any package documentation to `$DESTDIR` in case `$WITH_DOCS` is set
  to `0`.

* `$WITH_TESTS` is either `0`or `1` depending on whether a build
  without or with running the test suite was requested
  (`WithTests=no`). The build script should avoid running any unit or
  integration tests in case `$WITH_TESTS` is `0`.

* `$WITH_NETWORK` is either `0`or `1` depending on whether a build
  without or with networking is being executed (`WithNetwork=no`).
  The build script should avoid any network communication in case
  `$WITH_NETWORK` is `0`.

# EXAMPLES

Create and run a raw *GPT* image with *ext4*, as `image.raw`:

```bash
# mkosi --bootable --incremental boot
```

Create and run a bootable *GPT* image, as `foobar.raw`:

```bash
# mkosi --format disk --bootable -o foobar.raw
# mkosi --output foobar.raw boot
# mkosi --output foobar.raw qemu
```

Create and run a *Fedora Linux* image into a plain directory:

```bash
# mkosi --distribution fedora --format directory boot
```

Create a compressed image `image.raw.xz` and add a checksum file, and
install *SSH* into it:

```bash
# mkosi --distribution fedora --format disk --checksum --compress-output --package=openssh-clients
```

Inside the source directory of an `automake`-based project, configure
*mkosi* so that simply invoking `mkosi` without any parameters builds
an OS image containing a built version of the project in its current
state:

```bash
# cat >mkosi.conf <<EOF
[Distribution]
Distribution=fedora
Release=24

[Output]
Format=disk
Bootable=yes

[Content]
Packages=openssh-clients,httpd
BuildPackages=make,gcc,libcurl-devel
EOF
# cat >mkosi.build <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
cd $SRCDIR
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make -j `nproc`
make install
EOF
# chmod +x mkosi.build
# mkosi --bootable --incremental boot
# systemd-nspawn -bi image.raw
```

To create a *Fedora Linux* image with hostname:
```bash
# mkosi --distribution fedora --hostname image
```

Also you could set hostname in configuration file:
```bash
# cat mkosi.conf
...
[Output]
Hostname=image
...
```

# REQUIREMENTS

mkosi is packaged for various distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Arch
Linux, Fedora Linux, OpenMandriva, Gentoo. It is usually easiest to use the
distribution package.

The latest code from git requires systemd 253.

When not using distribution packages make sure to install the
necessary dependencies. For example, on *Fedora Linux* you need:

```bash
dnf install btrfs-progs apt debootstrap dosfstools mtools edk2-ovmf e2fsprogs squashfs-tools gnupg python3 tar xfsprogs xz zypper sbsigntools
```

On Debian/Ubuntu it might be necessary to install the `ubuntu-keyring`,
`ubuntu-archive-keyring` and/or `debian-archive-keyring` packages explicitly,
in addition to `apt` and `debootstrap`, depending on what kind of distribution images
you want to build. `debootstrap` on Debian only pulls in the Debian keyring
on its own, and the version on Ubuntu only the one from Ubuntu.

Note that the minimum required Python version is 3.7.
