# mkosi Changelog

## v10 (unreleased)

- Remove Arch Linux network automatic configuration to bring the different
  distros more in line with each other. To add it back, add a postinstall
  script to configure your network manager of choice.
- Change the --default option to not affect the search location of
  mkosi.default.d anymore. mkosi now always searches for mkosi.default.d
  in the working directory.
- Drop "quiet" from the default kernel command line.
- `--source-file-transfer` and `--source-file-transfer-final` now accept the
  empty string as an argument which can be used to override a previously
  set value.
- Add a new command `genkey` to mkosi that can be used to generate secure boot
  keys for usage with mkosi's `--secure-boot` options. The number of days the
  keys should remain valid can be specified via `--secure-boot-valid-days=` and
  their CN via `--secure-boot-common-name=`

## v9

### Highlighted Changes

- The mkosi Github action now defaults to the current release of mkosi instead
  of the tip of the master branch.
- Add a `ssh` verb and accompanying `--ssh` option. The latter sets up SSH keys
  for direct SSH access into a booted image, whereas the former can be used to
  start an SSH connection to the image.
- Allow for distribution specific `mkosi.*` files in subdirectories of
  `mkosi.default.d/`. These files are only processed if a subdirectory named
  after the target distribution of the image is found in `mkosi.default.d/`.
- The summary of used options for the image is now only printed when building
  the image for the first time or when the `summary` verb is used.
- All of mkosi's output, except for the build script, will now go to
  stderr. There was no clear policy on this before and this choice makes it
  easier to use images generated and booted via mkosi with language servers
  using stdin and stdout for communication.
- `--source-file-transfer` now defaults to `copy-git-others` to also include
  untracked files.
- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) is now used as a code style and
  conformance with it is checked in CI.
- Add a new `--ephemeral` option to boot into a temporary snapshot of the image
  that will be thrown away on shutdown.
- Add a new option `--network-veth` to set up a virtual Ethernet link between
  the host and the image for usage with nspawn or QEMU
- Add a new `--autologin` option to automatically log into the root account upon
  boot of the image. This is useful when using mkosi for boot tests.
- Add a new `--hostonly` option to generate host specific initrds. This is
  useful when using mkosi for boot tests.
- Add a new `--install-directory` option and special directory
  `mkosi.installdir/` that will be used as `$DESTDIR` for the build script, so
  that the contents of this directory can be shared between builds.
- Add a new `--include-directory` option and special directory
  `mkosi.includedir/` that will be mounted at `/usr/include` during the
  build. This way headers files installed during the build can be made available
  to the host system, which is useful for usage with language servers.
- Add a new `--source-file-transfer-final` option to complement
  `--source-file-transfer`. It does the same `--source-file-transfer` does for
  the build image, but for the final one.
- Add a new `--tar-strip-selinux-context` option to remove SELinux xattrs. This
  is useful when an image with a target distribution not using SELinux is
  generated on a host that is using it.
- Document the `--no-chown` option. Using this option, artifacts generated by
  mkosi are not chowned to the user invoking mkosi when it is invoked via
  sudo. It has been with as for a while, but hasn't been documented until now.
